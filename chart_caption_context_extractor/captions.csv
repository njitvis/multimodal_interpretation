7,WGI_TAR_full_report.pdf,"Figure 12.12: (a) Estimates of the “scaling factors” by which we have to multiply the amplitude of several model-simulated signals to reproduce
the corresponding changes in the observed record. The vertical bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal variability. A range
encompassing unity implies that this combination of forcing amplitude and model-simulated response is consistent with the corresponding
observed change, while a range encompassing zero implies that this model-simulated signal is not detectable (Allen and Stott, 2000; Stott et al.,
2000a). Signals are defined as the ensemble mean response to external forcing expressed in large-scale (>5000 km) near-surface temperatures over
the 1946 to 1996 period relative to the 1896 to 1996 mean. The first entry (G) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence interval obtained
if we assume the observations consist only of a response to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. The range is significantly less than one
(consistent with results from other models), meaning that models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly overpredict the observed
warming signal. The next eight entries show scaling factors for model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing (GS), with two
cases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, one of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion (GSI and GSIO respec-
tively). All but one (CGCM1) of these ranges is consistent with unity. Hence there is little evidence that models are systematically over- or under-
predicting the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption that model-simulated GS signals and internal variability are an adequate
representation (i.e. that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). Observed residual variability is consistent with this assumption
in all but one case (ECHAM3, indicated by the asterisk). We are obliged to make this assumption to include models for which only a simulation
of the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single-signal cases are incomplete since they do not account for
uncertainty in the naturally forced response. These ranges indicate, however, the high level of confidence with which we can reject internal
variability as simulated by these various models as an explanation of recent near-surface temperature change.
A more complete uncertainty analysis is provided by the next three entries, which show corresponding scaling factors on individual
greenhouse (G), sulphate (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only (V) signals for those cases in which the relevant simula-
tions have been performed. In these cases, we estimate multiple factors simultaneously to account for uncertainty in the amplitude of the naturally
forced response. The uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. In one case (ECHAM3) the model appears
to be overestimating the greenhouse response (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with unity), but this result is sensitive to which
component of the control is used to define the detection space. It is also not known how it would respond to the inclusion of a volcanic signal. In
cases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 and HadCM3), G and S signals remain detectable and consistent with unity
independent of whether natural signals are estimated jointly or separately (allowing for different errors in S and V responses). (b) Estimated
contributions to global mean warming over the 20th century, based on the results shown in (a), with 5 to 95% confidence intervals. Although the
estimates vary depending on which model’s signal and what forcing is assumed, and are less certain if more than one signal is estimated, all show
a significant contribution from anthropogenic climate change to 20th century warming (from Allen et al., 2000a).",./images/7.png

45,CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE.pdf,"Figure 3.7 Percentage increase in fuel use per kWh of electricity due to CO2 capture, compared to the same plant without capture (Source data:
Davison, 2005; IEA GHG, 2004; IEA GHG, 2003; IEA GHG, 2000b; Dillon et al., 2005).
a. The increase in fuel required to produce a kWh of electricity is calculated by comparing the same type of plant with and without capture. The
increase in fuel consumption depends on the type of baseline plant without capture. For example, the increase in energy consumption for a GE
IGCC plant with capture compared to a coal steam cycle baseline plant without capture would be 40% as opposed to the lower value shown
in the figure that was calculated relative to the same type of baseline plant without capture.
b. The direct energy consumptions for CO2 separation are lower for pre-combustion capture than for post-combustion capture, because CO2
is removed from a more concentrated, higher pressure gas, so a physical rather than a chemical solvent can be used.
c. The ‘Fuel gas processing and related impacts’ category for IGCC includes shift conversion of the fuel gas and the effects on the gas turbine
combined cycle of removal of CO2 from the fuel gas and use of hydrogen as a fuel instead of syngas. For natural gas pre-combustion capture
this category also includes partial oxidation/steam reforming of the natural gas.
d. The energy consumption for CO2 compression is lower in pre-combustion capture than in post-combustion capture because some of the CO2
leaves the separation unit at elevated pressure.
e. The energy consumption for CO2 compression in the oxy-fuel processes depends on the composition of the extracted product, namely 75%
by volume in the coal-fired plant and 93% by volume in the gas fired plant. Impurities are cryogenically removed from the CO2
during compression, to give a final CO2 purity of 96% by volume. The energy consumption of the cryogenic CO2
separation unit is included in the CO2 compression power consumption.
f. The ‘Oxygen production and power plant impacts’ category for oxy-fuel processes includes the power consumption for oxygen production
and the impacts of CO2 capture on the rest of the power plant, that is excluding CO2 compression and purification. In the coal-fired oxy-fuel
plant, the efficiency of the rest of the power plant increases slightly, for example due to the absence of a flue gas desulphurization (FGD)
unit. The efficiency of the rest of the gas fired oxy-fuel plant decreases because of the change of working fluid in the power cycle from air to
recycled flue gas.",./images/45.png

Ch 19, Figure 19.4 and highlighting the nature of this dependence between 0degC and 2degC warming above pre-industrial levels. As in the AR5, literature was used to make 
expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high (purple). 
The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by very high risk 
of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility, or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with a limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the 
hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes 
autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation (RFC 1, 3, 5) independently of development pathway. The rate and timing of impacts were taken into 
account in assessing RFC 1 and 5. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the Ch 3 authors. RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human 
systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, 
the Arctic and its indigenous people, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and 
ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts 
that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: 
global monetary damage, global scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. RFC5 Large-scale singular events: are relatively large, abrupt and sometimes 
irreversible changes in systems that are caused by global warming. Examples include disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The grey bar represents the range 
of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006-2015.",./images/304.png

organism are described by its performance curve (exemplified for an animal). Each performance (e.g., exercise, growth, reproduction) is maximal at its optimum temperature (Topt
), and becomes progressively constrained during cooling or warming. Surpassing the first low- and high-temperature thresholds (Tp; p, pejus: getting worse) means going into
time-limited tolerance. Once further cooling or warming surpasses the next low or high thresholds (Tc; c, critical), oxygen availability becomes insufficient and an anaerobic
metabolism begins. Denaturation temperatures (Td) are even more extreme and characterized by the onset of damage to cells and proteins. Horizontal arrows indicate that Tp, Tc
,and Td thresholds of an individual can shift, within limits, between summer and winter (seasonal acclimatization) or when the species adapts to a cooler or warmer climate over
generations (evolutionary adaptation). Under elevated CO2 levels (ocean acidification) and in hypoxic waters performance levels can decrease and thermal windows narrow
(dashed gray curves). (b) The width of the thermal range (horizontal arrows) also changes over time when an individual develops from egg to larva to adult and gains weight and

The black bar shows the estimated uncertainty range of GHG emissions implied by the Cancun Pledges. The middle panel denotes the average annual CO2 emission reduction rates 
for the 2030-2050 period. It compares the median and interquartile range across scenarios from recent intermodel comparisons with explicit 2030 interim goals to the range of 
scenarios in the Scenario Database for WGIII AR5. Annual rates of historical emission changes (sustained over a period of 20 years) are shown as well. The arrows in the right panel 
show the magnitude of zero and low-carbon energy supply upscaling from between 2030 and 2050, subject to different 2030 GHG emission levels. Zero- and low-carbon energy 
supply includes renewable energy, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Only scenarios that apply 
the full, unconstrained mitigation technology portfolio of the underlying models (default technology assumption) are shown. Scenarios with large net negative global emissions 
(>20 GtCO2-eq/yr), scenarios with exogenous carbon price assumptions, and scenarios with 2010 emission levels that are significantly outside the historical range are excluded.

1990s; about 2000) (numerical values are also listed in Table 6.11). For detailed explanations see Section 6.13. The height of the rectangular bar
denotes a central or best estimate value while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line about the rectangular bar with 'x'
delimiters indicates an estimate of the uncertainty range, guided by the spread in the published values of the forcing and physical understanding. A
vertical line without a rectangular bar and with 'o' delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central estimate can be given owing to large
uncertainties. The uncertainty range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use of the term elsewhere in this
document. A 'level of scientific understanding' (LOSU) index is accorded to each forcing, with H, M, L and VL denoting high, medium, low and
very low levels, respectively. This represents our subjective judgement about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the
assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of our knowledge of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and the
uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see Table 6.12). The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped together into a
single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO2, CH4, N2O, and halocarbons (see Tables 6.1 and 6.11) shown; halocar-
bons refers to all halogen-containing compounds listed in Table 6.1. 'FF' denotes fossil fuel burning while 'BB' denotes biomass burning
aerosol. Fossil fuel burning is separated into the 'black carbon' (bc) and 'organic carbon' (oc) components with its separate best estimate and
range. The sign of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric aerosols is poorly understood.
The same is true for the forcing due to aviation via their effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the first type of indirect effect due to aerosols
as applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The second type of effect is conceptually important but there exists very little
confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly variable
over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, see Figure 6.8d). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal features
(Figure 6.7) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They are only
intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual mean scale, and cannot be readily employed to obtain the climate
response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global mean forcings
cannot be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in terms of the complete global climate impact.",./images/909.png

about 2000) (numerical values are also listed in Table 6.11 of Chapter 6). For detailed explanations, see Chapter 6.13. The height of the rectangular
bar denotes a central or best estimate value, while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line about the rectangular bar with “x”
delimiters indicates an estimate of the uncertainty range, for the most part guided by the spread in the published values of the forcing. A vertical line
without a rectangular bar and with “o” delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The
uncertainty range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use of the term elsewhere in this document. A “level of scientific
understanding” index is accorded to each forcing, with high, medium, low and very low levels, respectively. This represents the subjective judgement
about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of knowledge of
the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see Table 6.12).
The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped together into a single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO2, CH4, N2O and
halocarbons shown (see Tables 6.1 and 6.11). Fossil fuel burning is separated into the “black carbon” and “organic carbon” components with its
separate best estimate and range. The sign of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric aerosols
is poorly understood. The same is true for the forcing due to aviation via its effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the “first” type of indirect effect
due to aerosols as applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The “second” type of effect is conceptually important, but there exists
very little confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly
variable over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, see Figure 6.8). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal features
(Figure 6.7) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They are only
intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual mean scale and cannot be readily employed to obtain the climate
response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global mean forcings cannot
be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in terms of the complete global climate impact. [Based on Figure 6.6]",./images/1231.png

2000b, and Figure 12.7c). This estimate will be contaminated by uncertainty in the model-simulated forced response, together with observation
noise and sampling error. However, unlike the detrending procedure, all of these introduce a positive (upward) bias in the resulting estimate of the
observed spectrum. The dotted line therefore provides a conservative (high) estimate of observed internal variability at all frequencies. Asterisks
indicate models whose variability is significantly less than observed variability on 10 to 60 year time-scales after removing either a best-fit linear
trend or an independent estimate of the forced response from the observed series. Significance is based on an F-test on the ratio observed/model
mean power over this frequency interval and quoted at the 5% level. Power spectral density (PSD) is defined such that unit-variance uncorrelated
noise would have an expected PSD of unity (see Allen et al., 2000a, for details). Note that different normalisation conventions can lead to different
values, which appear as a constant offset up or down on the logarithmic vertical scale used here. Differences between the spectra shown here and
the corresponding figure in Stouffer et al. (2000) shown in Chapter 8, Figure 8.18 are due to the use here of a longer (1861 to 2000) observational
record, as opposed to 1881 to 1991 in Figure 8.18. That figure also shows 2.5 to 97.5% uncertainty ranges, while for consistency with other

of seasonal activities (e.g., elicited by spring warming cues) to earlier, or can benefit only one of two interacting species (e.g., in predator–prey dynamics or competition), causing
shifts in predominance. (b) During climate warming a largely unchanged thermal range of a species causes it to follow its normal temperatures as it moves or is displaced,
typically resulting in a poleward shift of the biogeographic range (exemplified for the Northern Hemisphere; modified after Beaugrand, 2009). The polygon delineates the

two no-mitigation baseline cases, Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B (dark red bars) and SRES A1FI (orange bars). Impacts avoided are larger if the A1FI baseline
scenario is used than if the A1B baseline is used, because greenhouse gas emissions in A1FI exceed those in A1B (see Section 19.7.1). Since the literature does not provide
estimates of avoided impacts relative to the A1FI baseline for all sectors considered here, some bars are absent from the panel (a). (b) The dependence of the potential to avoid
climate change impacts upon the timing of emission reductions is illustrated. Climate change impacts avoided by the same early, rapid mitigation scenario compared to the
no-mitigation baseline case SRES A1B (dark red bars) are shown. The information displayed is identical to the orange bars in (a), but a comparison is now made with the impacts
avoided from two other less stringent mitigation scenarios. Impacts avoided if global emissions peak in 2016 but are subsequently reduced more slowly (2% annually) are lower
(light brown bars compared to dark red bars). However, if mitigation occurs later, so that global emissions do not peak until 2030, even if emissions are subsequently reduced at
5% annually, the avoided impacts are smaller than in either of the other two cases (yellow bars compared to dark red and light brown bars). Both panels show the uncertainty
range (error bars) due to regional climate change projected with seven global climate models. Errors due to uncertainty within impacts models are not shown. Uncertainties
associated with sea level rise related impacts are not provided because the models used a single sea level rise projection. Because increases and decreases in water stress, flood
risks, and crop suitability are not co-located and affect different regions, these effects are not combined. Since some areas become wetter and others drier (WGI AR5 Section
12.4.5), there are regions where climate change results in decreases in flood, drought, or water stress, which may be beneficial. This means that avoided benefits of climate
change, as well as avoided impacts of climate change, are also shown here, as the shorter blue bars. Overall the avoided impacts greatly outweigh the avoided benefits (Arnell et
al., 2013;Warren et al., 2013a,b).",./images/1512.png

range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006–2015. The assessment of changing risk levels and associated confidence were primarily derived from the expert judgement
of Gattuso et al. (2015) and the lead authors and relevant contributing authors of Chapter 3 (SR1.5), while additional input was received from the many reviewers of the
ocean systems section of SR1.5. Notes: (i) The analysis shown here is not intended to be comprehensive. The examples of organisms, ecosystems and sectors included here are
intended to illustrate the scale, types and projection of risks for representative natural and human ocean systems. (ii) The evaluation of risks by experts did not consider genetic
adaptation, acclimatization or human risk reduction strategies (mitigation and societal adaptation). (iii) As discussed elsewhere (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5, Box 3.4; Gattuso
et al., 2015), ocean acidification is also having impacts on organisms and ecosystems as carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere. These changes are part of the responses
reported here, although partitioning the effects of the two drivers is difficult at this point in time and hence was not attempted. (iv) Confidence levels for location of transition
points between levels of risk (L = low, M = moderate, H = high and VH = very high) are assessed and presented here as in the accompanying study by Gattuso et al. (2015).

of interpretation. Rates of climate change of 0.01 °C yr-1 correspond to approximately 3.3 km yr-1 median climate velocity in the ocean. When compared to observed rates of
displacement (c), many marine taxonomic groups have been able to track these velocities. For phytoplankton and zooplankton the rates of displacement greatly exceed median

The top panel compares reconstructions to an EBM simulation (equilibrium climate

solar and anthropogenic forcing. All timeseries are centered on the 1500-1925 
average. Instrumental temperature data are shown by a green line (centered to 
agree with CH-blend average over the period 1880-1960). The displayed data are

contribution of the response to volcanic (blue lines with blue uncertainty shade), solar 
(green) and greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol forcing (red line with yellow shades, 
aerosol only in 20th century) to each reconstruction (all timeseries are centered 
over the analysis period). The estimates are based on multiple regression of the 
reconstructions on fi ngerprints for individual forcings. The contributions to different 
reconstructions are indicated by different line styles (Briffa et al.: solid, fat; Esper et 
al.: dotted; Moberg: dashed; CH-blend: solid, thin; with shaded 90% confi dence limits

two different climate models (ECHAM3/LSG and HadCM2) and data from five climate models. (a) Comparison of the amplitude of a single
greenhouse gas + sulphate aerosol (GS) signal (expressed as change in global mean temperature [°C] over 50 years). Results show that a significant
GS signal can be detected in observed trend patterns 1949 to 1998 at a 5% significance level (one-sided test), independent of which pair of finger-
prints was used. The observed signal amplitude is consistent with contemporaneous GS amplitudes for most models’ GS simulations. 90%
confidence intervals are shown by solid lines for estimates using ECHAM3/LSG fingerprints and by dashed lines for estimates based on HadCM2
fingerprints. Cases where a model’s and the observed amplitude disagree are marked by a cross on the axis. (b) and (c) show an estimate of the
observed amplitude of a greenhouse gas signal (horizontal axis) and a sulphate aerosol signal (vertical axis) estimated simultaneously. Both signal
amplitudes can be estimated as positive from observations based on ECHAM3/LSG fingerprints shown in (b) while only the greenhouse gas signal
is detected based on HadCM2 fingerprints shown in panel (c). The amplitudes of both signals from the observations are compared with those from
model simulations forced with various forcing histories and using different climate models (1: HadCM2; 2: ECHAM3/LSG; 3: GFDL; 4:
ECHAM4/OPYC; 5: CCCma1; 6: CCCma2). Simulations with symbols shown in black are consistent with observations relative to the uncertainty
in observations (grey ellipse) and that of the model simulations (not shown). Simulations which are inconsistent are shown in grey. Model simula-
tions where only a single ensemble member is available are illustrated by thin symbols, those based on ensembles of simulations by fat symbols.
Results from consistency tests indicate that most greenhouse gas only simulations (G, shown by “×”) are inconsistent with observations. Ten of
the GS simulations in both panels are in agreement with observed trend patterns, discrepancies arise mostly from the magnitude of a sulphate signal
(vertical axis). The failure to detect a sulphate signal as well as a greenhouse gas signal in panel (c) is due to the two signals being very highly
correlated if only spatial patterns are used- this makes separation of the signals difficult. These results show that estimates of a sulphate aerosol
signal from observations are model dependent and quite uncertain, while a single anthropogenic signal can be estimated with more confidence.
All units are in °C/50 year, values in the upper right quadrant refer to a physically meaningful greenhouse warming and sulphate aerosol cooling
signal. The consistency test establishes whether the difference between a model’s and the observed amplitude estimate is significantly larger than the
combined uncertainty in the observations (internal variability + observational uncertainty) and the model simulation (internal variability). The figure
is derived by updating the data used by Barnett et al. (1999) (for details of the analysis see Hegerl et al., 2000) and then applying a simple linear
transformation of the multi-regression results (Hegerl and Allen, 2000).
Results for 1946 to 1995 period used by Barnett et al. (1999) are similar, except fewer of the models in b and c agree with observations and the
case of both signals being zero in c is not rejected. Simulations of natural forcing only ending before 1998 are also rejected in that case.",./images/1992.png

analyses of two common and long-lived benthic taxa, Cibicidoides and Nuttallides. To correct for genus-specifi c isotope vital effects, the 18O values were adjusted by +0.64 and 
+0.4 (Shackleton et al., 1984), respectively. The ages are relative to the geomagnetic polarity time scale of Berggren et al. (1995). The raw data were smoothed using a fi ve-
point running mean, and curve-fi tted with a locally weighted mean. The 18O temperature values assume an ice-free ocean (-1.0%0 Standard Mean Ocean Water), and thus only 
apply to the time preceding large-scale antarctic glaciation (~35 Ma). After the early Oligocene much of the variability (~70%) in the 18O record refl ects changes in antarctic and

south Atlantic and Pacifi c (see Zachos et al., 2003 for details). The rapid decrease in carbon isotope ratios in the top panel is indicative of a large increase in atmospheric 
greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 that was coincident with an approximately 5degC global warming (centre panel). Using the carbon isotope records, numerical models show that 
CH4 released by the rapid decomposition of marine hydrates might have been a major component (~2,000 GtC) of the carbon fl ux (Dickens and Owen, 1996). Testing of this and 
other models requires an independent constraint on the carbon fl uxes. In theory, much of the additional greenhouse carbon would have been absorbed by the ocean, thereby 
lowering seawater pH and causing widespread dissolution of seafl oor carbonates. Such a response is evident in the lower panel, which shows a transient reduction in the 
carbonate (CaCO3) content of sediments in two cores from the south Atlantic (Zachos et al., 2004, 2005). The observed patterns indicate that the ocean's carbonate saturation 
horizon rapidly shoaled more than 2 km, and then gradually recovered as buffering processes slowly restored the chemical balance of the ocean. Initially, most of the carbonate 
dissolution is of sediment deposited prior to the event, a process that offsets the apparent timing of the dissolution horizon relative to the base of the benthic foraminifer carbon 
isotope excursion. Model simulations show that the recovery of the carbonate saturation horizon should precede the recovery in the carbon isotopes by as much as 100 kyr 
(Dickens and Owen, 1996), another feature that is evident in the sediment records.",./images/2079.png

and cloud albedo RFs only (dashed blue curve). Surface albedo, contrails and stratospheric water vapour RFs are included in the total curve but not in the others. For all of the

the grid-boxes in which each species was examined. At each location, all
of which are in the Northern Hemisphere, the changing trait is compared
with modelled temperatures driven by: (a) natural forcings (purple bars),
(b) anthropogenic (i.e., human) forcings (orange bars), and (c) combined
natural and anthropogenic forcings (yellow bars). In addition, on each
panel the frequencies of the correlation coefficients between the actual
temperatures recorded during each study and changes in the traits of 83
species, the only ones of the 145 with reported local-temperature trends,
are shown (dark blue bars). On average the number of years that species
were examined is about 28, with average starting and ending years of
1960 and 1998. Note that the agreement: (a) between the natural and
actual plots is weaker (K = 60.16) than (b) between the anthropogenic
and actual (K = 35.15), which in turn is weaker than( c) the agreement
between combined and actual (K = 3.65). Taken together, these plots
show that a measurable portion of the warming regional temperatures to
which species are reacting can be attributed to humans, therefore
showing joint attribution (after Root et al., 2005).",./images/2289.png

The ocean model results appear smooth because they contain no

subsequent years were simulated using a CO2 concentration scenario
rather than actual measurements, leading to a likely overestimate of

historical CO2 concentrations, climate variations, and land-use
changes based on Ramankutty and Foley (2000). The results were

rainfall change for inland southern Australia in 2100 extrapolated from
CSIRO (1996) with temperature sampled randomly across the projected
ranges of both global and normalised regional warming and then
multiplied together. Projected regional ranges for normalised seasonal
rainfall change were randomly sampled, multiplied by the randomly
sampled global warming as above, and then averaged. The resulting
probability density surface reveals the likelihood of different climate
change outcomes for this region; (b) Response surface of irrigation
demand for the same region superimposed on projected climate changes

irrigation water supply. Risk can be calculated by summing the
probabilities of all climates below a given level of annual exceedance of
annual water supply; e.g., 50%, or exceedance of the annual water limit
in at least one of every two years. (Source: Jones, 2000b.)",./images/2359.png
