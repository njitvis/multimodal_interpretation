    "        - Use **specific numerical comparisons** instead of vague terms like *\"significant,\" \"important,\" or \"major changes\"*.  \n",
    "        - Example: ✅ *\"What is the percentage increase in sales from 2015 to 2020?\"*  \n",
    "\n",
    "        2. **Clearly define the scope.**  \n",
    "        - Specify **time periods, categories, or comparison criteria** to avoid ambiguity.  \n",

    "\n",

    "        - Do not include *\"why\"* unless causation is explicitly provided in the chart.  \n",
    "        - Example: ✅ *\"What was the CO₂ emission increase (in percentage) from 2019 to 2020?\"*  \n",
    "\n",
    "        4. **Ensure all questions are fully answerable using the given chart.**  \n",
    "        - The questions should require no external knowledge.  \n",
    "        - Example: ✅ *\"How does the GDP growth rate shown in the chart correlate with inflation trends?\"*  \n",
    "\n",
    "        ### **Format for Output:**  \n",
