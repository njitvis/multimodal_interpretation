decrease in ph of units ipcc working group fourth assessment. however the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented. much more evidence has accumulated over the past five years to indicate that changes in many physical and biological systems are linked to anthropogenic warming. there are four sets of evidence which taken together support this conclusion. the working group concluded that most of the observed increase in the globally averaged temperature since the mid th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. of the more than observational data series from studies that show significant change in many physical and biological systems more than are consistent with the direction of change expected as response to warming figure spm. global synthesis of studies in this assessment strongly demonstrates that the spatial agreement between regions of significant warming across the globe and the locations of significant observed changes in many systems consistent with warming is very unlikely to be due solely to natural variability of temperatures or natural variability of the systems figure spm. finally there have been several modelling studies that have linked responses in some physical and biological systems to anthropogenic warming by comparing observed responses in these systems with modelled responses in which the natural forcings solar activity and volcanoes and anthropogenic forcings greenhouse gases and aerosols are explicitly separated. models with combined natural and anthropogenic forcings simulate observed responses significantly better than models with natural forcing only. limitations and gaps prevent more complete attribution of the causes of observed system responses to anthropogenic warming. first the available analyses are limited in the number of systems and locations considered. second natural temperature variability is larger at the regional than at the global scale thus affecting identification of changes due to external forcing. finally at the regional scale other factors such as land use change pollution and invasive species are influential. nevertheless the consistency between observed and modelled changes in several studies and the spatial agreement between significant regional warming and consistent impacts at the global scale is sufficient to conclude with high confidence that anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has had discernible influence on many physical and biological systems. effects of temperature increases have been documented in the following medium confidence effects on agricultural and forestry management at northern hemisphere higher latitudes such as earlier spring planting of crops and alterations in disturbance regimes of forests due to fires and pests some aspects of human health such as heat related mortality in europe infectious disease vectors in some areas and allergenic pollen in northern hemisphere high and mid latitudes es some human activities in the arctic hunting and travel over snow and ice and in lower elevation alpine areas such as mountain sports. recent climate changes and climate variations are beginning to have effects on many other natural and human systems. however based on the published literature the impacts have not yet become established trends. governmental institutions in some places have begun to respond by building dams and drainage works. in the sahelian region of africa warmer and drier conditions have led to reduced length of growing season with detrimental effects on crops. in southern africa longer dry seasons and more uncertain rainfall are prompting adaptation measures. sea level rise and human development

sector and region for the range of unmitigated climate changes projected by the ipcc over this century judged to be relevant for people and the environment the impacts frequently reflect projected changes in precipitation and other climate variables in addition to temperature sea level and concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. the magnitude and timing of impacts will vary with the amount and timing of climate change and in some cases the capacity to adapt. these issues are discussed further in later sections of the summary. freshwater resources and their management by mid century annual average river runoff and water availability are projected to increase by at high latitudes and in some wet tropical areas and decrease by over some dry regions at mid latitudes and in the dry tropics some of which are presently water stressed areas. in some places and in particular seasons changes differ from these annual figures. heavy precipitation events which are very likely to increase in frequency will augment flood risk. working group table spm working group ii fourth assessment cover are projected to decline reducing water availability in regions wheremorethan one sixth of the world population currently lives. adaptation procedures and risk management practices for the water sector are being developed in some countries and regions that have recognised projected hydrological changes with related uncertainties. ecosystems the resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded this century by an unprecedented combination of climate change associated disturbances flooding drought wildfire insects ocean acidification and other global change drivers land use change pollution over exploitation of resources. to over the course of this century net carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems is likely to peak before mid century and then weaken or even reverse thus amplifying climate change. es approximately of plant and animal species assessed so

consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services water and food supply. the progressive acidification of oceans due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell forming organisms corals and their dependent species. food fibre and forest products crop productivity is projected to increase slightly at mid to high latitudes for local mean temperature increases of up to depending on the crop and then decrease beyond that in some regions. at lower latitudes especially seasonally dry and tropical regions crop productivity is projected to decrease for even small local temperature increases which would increase the risk of hunger. globally the potential for food production is projected to increase with increases in local average

which depend on highly utilised water resources. cities that currently experience heatwaves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number intensity and duration of heatwaves during the course of the century with potential for adverse health impacts. coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution. population growth and the rising value of infrastructure in coastal areas increase vulnerability to climate variability and future climate change with losses projected to increase if the intensity of tropical storms increases. current adaptation is uneven and readiness for increased exposure is low. polar regions in the polar regions the main projected biophysical effects are reductions in thickness and extent of glaciers and ice sheets and changes in natural ecosystems with detrimental effects on many organisms including migratory birds mammals and higher predators. in the arctic additional impacts include reductions in the extent of sea ice and permafrost increased coastal erosion and an increase in the depth of permafrost seasonal thawing. for human communities in thearctic impacts particularly those resulting from changing snow and ice conditions are projected to be mixed. detrimental impacts would include those on infrastructure and traditional indigenous ways of life. in both polar regions specific ecosystems and habitats are projected to be vulnerable as climatic barriers to species invasions are lowered. arctic human communities are already adapting to climate change but both external and internal stressors challenge their adaptive capacities. despite the resilience shown historically by arctic indigenous communities some traditional ways of life are being threatened and substantial investments are needed to adapt or re locate physical structures and communities. es small islands small islands whether located in the tropics or higher latitudes have characteristics which make them especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change sea level rise and extreme events. deterioration in coastal conditions for example through erosion of beaches and coral bleaching is expected to affect local resources fisheries and reduce the value of these destinations for tourism. sea level rise is expected to exacerbate inundation storm surge erosion and other coastal hazards thus threatening vital infrastructure settlements and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities. climate change is projected by mid century to reduce water resources in many small islands in the caribbean and pacific to the point where they become insufficient to meet demand during low rainfall periods. with higher temperatures increased invasion by non native species is expected to occur particularly on mid and high latitude islands. since the ipcc third assessment many additional studies particularly in regions that previously had been little researched have enabled more systematic understanding of how the timing and magnitude of impacts may be affected by changes in climate and sea level associated with differing amounts and rates of change in global average temperature. examples of this new information are presented in figure spm. entries have been selected which are judged to be relevant for people and the environment and for which there is high confidence in the assessment all examples of impact are drawn from chapters of the assessment where more detailed information is available. depending on circumstances some of these impacts could be associated with key vulnerabilities based on number of criteria in the literature magnitude timing persistence reversibility the potential for adaptation distributional aspects

of phenomena are for ipcc sres projections of climate change. very large sea level rises that would result from widespread deglaciation of greenland and west antarctic ice sheets imply major changes in coastlines and ecosystems and inundation of low lying areas with greatest effects in river deltas. there is medium confidence that at least partial deglaciation of the greenland ice sheet and possibly the west antarctic ice sheet would occur over period of time ranging from centuries to millennia for global average temperature increase of relative to causing contribution to sea level rise

transition during the st century. slowing of the moc during this century is very likely but temperatures over the atlantic and europe are projected to increase nevertheless due to global warming. impacts of large scale and persistent changes in the moc are likely to include changes to marine ecosystem productivity fisheries ocean carbon dioxide uptake oceanic oxygen concentrations and terrestrial vegetation working group fourth assessment working group ii fourth assessment. this assessment makes it clear that the impacts of future climate change will be mixed across regions. for increases in global mean temperature of less than above levels some impacts are projected to produce benefits in some places and some sectors and produce costs in other places and other sectors. it is however projected that some low latitude and polar regions will experience net costs even for small increases in temperature. it is very likely that all regions will experience either declines in net benefits or increases in net costs for increases in temperature greater than about es es. these observations confirm evidence reported in the third assessment that while developing countries are expected to experience larger percentage losses global mean losses could be gdpfor of warming. many estimates of aggregate net economic costs of damages from climate change across the globe the social cost of carbon scc expressed in terms of future net benefits and costs that are discounted to the present are now available. peer reviewed estimates of the scc for have an average value of us per tonne of carbon us per tonne of carbon dioxide but the range around this mean is large. the large ranges of scc are due in the large part to differences in assumptions regarding climate sensitivity response lags the treatment of risk and equity economic and non economic impacts the inclusion of potentially catastrophic losses and discount rates. it is very likely that globally aggregated figures underestimate the damage costs because they cannot include many non quantifiable impacts. taken as whole the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time. it is virtually certain that aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors regions countries and populations. in some locations and among some groups of people with high exposure high sensitivity and or low adaptive capacity net costs will be significantly larger than the global aggregate es. summary for policymakers impacts of climate change will vary regionally but aggregated and discounted to the present they are very likely to impose net annual costs which will increase over time as global temperatures increase. impacts due to altered frequencies and intensities of extreme weather climate and sea level events are very likely to change. some large scale climate events have the potential to cause very large impacts especially after the st century",source_PDF:"./PDFs/2007 Impact, adaption.pdf",image_page_number:26,chart_type:"horizontal bar"},{image_id:3,caption:"Figure TS.1.

since the third assessment tar the need for improved decision analysis has motivated an expansion in the number of climate change impacts adaptation and vulnerability cciav approaches and methods in use. while scientific research aims to reduce uncertainty decision making aims to manage uncertainty by making the best possible use of the available knowledge. this usually involves close collaboration between researchers and stakeholders. therefore although the standard climate scenario driven approach is used in large proportion of assessments described in this report the use of other approaches is increasing. they include assessments of current and future adaptations to climate variability and change adaptive capacity social vulnerability multiple stresses and adaptation in the context of sustainable development. risk management can be applied in all of these contexts. it is designed for decision making under uncertainty several detailed frameworks have been developed for cciav assessments and its use is expanding rapidly. the advantages of risk management include the use of formalised methods to manage uncertainty stakeholder involvement use of methods for evaluating policy options without being policy prescriptive integration of different disciplinary approaches and mainstreaming of climate change concerns into the broader decision making context. stakeholders bring vital input into cciav assessments about range of risks and their management. in particular how group or system can cope with current climate risks provides solid basis for assessments of future risks. an increasing number of technical summary footnote continued from below box ts. at each location all of which are in the northern hemisphere the changing trait is compared

cold related mortality because of increasing winter temperatures. however on balance without adaptive measures health risks due to more frequent heatwaves especially in southern central and eastern

hydropower potential of europe is expected to decline on average by and by to around the mediterranean by the. it is anticipated that europe natural systems and biodi versity will be substantially affected by climate change very high confidence. the great majority of organisms and ecosystems are likely to have difficulty in adapting to climate change high confidence. sea level rise is likely to cause an inland migration of beaches and loss of up to of coastal wetlands reducing the habitat availability for several species that breed or forage in low lying coastal areas. small glaciers will disappear and larger glaciers substantially shrink projected volume reductions of between and by during the st century. many permafrost areas in the arctic are projected to dis appear. in the

areas under some scenarios. mountain communities face up to loss of species under high emissions scenarios by. large percentage of the european flora one study found up to is likely to become vulnerable endangered or committed to extinction by the end of this century. options for adaptation are likely to be limited for many organisms and ecosystems. for example limited dispersal is very likely to reduce the range of most reptiles and amphibians. the adaptive capacity of ecosystems can be enhanced by reduc ing human stresses. new sites for conservation may be needed because climate change is very likely to alter con ditions of suitability for many species in current sites with climate change to meet conservation goals the current reserve area in the eu would have to be increased

to benefit from experiences gained in reactions to extreme climate events by specifically implementing proactive climate change risk management adaptation plans very high confidence. since the tar governments have greatly increased the number of actions for coping with extreme climate events. current thinking about adaptation to extreme climate events has moved away from reactive disaster relief and towards more proactive risk management. prominent example is the implementation in several countries of early warning systems for heatwaves portugal spain france uk italy hungary. other actions have addressed long term climate change. for example national action plans have been developed for adapting to climate change and more specific plans have been incorporated into european and national policies for agriculture energy forestry transport and other sectors. research has also provided new insights into adaptation policies studies have shown that crops that become less economically viable under climate change can be profitably replaced by bioenergy crops. although the effectiveness and feasibility of adaptation measures are expected to vary greatly only few governments and institutions have systematically and critically examined portfolio of measures. as an example some reservoirs used now as measure for adapting to precipitation fluctuations may become unreliable in regions where long term precipitation is projected to decrease. the range of management options to cope with climate change varies largely among forest types with some types having many more options than others. latin america climatic variability and extreme events have been severely affecting the latin america region over recent years high confidence. recent developments in meteorological forecasting techniques could improve the necessary information for human welfare and security. however the lack of modern observation equipment and badly needed upper air information the low density of weather stations the unreliability of their reports and the lack of monitoring of climate variables hinder the quality of forecasts with adverse effects on the public lowering their appreciation of applied meteorological services as well as their trust in climate records. these shortcomings also affect observing services with negative impact on the quality of early warnings and alert advisories medium confidence. during the last few decades important changes in precipitation and increases in temperature have been observed high confidence. increases in rainfall in south east brazil paraguay uruguay the argentine pampas and some parts of bolivia have had impacts on land use and crop yields and have increased flood frequency and intensity. on the other hand declining trend in precipitation has been observed in southern chile south west argentina southern peru and western central america. increases in temperature of approximately in mesoamerica and south america and of in brazil have been observed. this issue is critical in bolivia peru colombia and ecuador where water availability has already been compromised either for consumption or hydropower generation. these problems with supply are expected to increase in the future becoming chronic if no appropriate adaptation measures are planned and implemented. over the next decades andean inter tropical glaciers are very likely to disappear affecting water availability and hydropower generation high confidence. land use changes have intensified the use of natural resources and exacerbated many of the processes of land degradation high confidence. the combined effects of human action and climate change have brought decline in natural land cover which continues to decline at very high rates high confidence. in particular rates of deforestation of tropical forests have increased during the last years. there is evidence that biomass burning aerosols may change regional temperature and precipitation in the southern part of amazonia medium confidence. the projected mean warming for latin america to the end of the st century according to different climate models ranges from to for sres emissions scenario and from to for scenario medium confidence. most gcm projections indicate rather larger than present positive and negative rainfall anomalies for the tropical portions of latin america and smaller ones for extra tropical south america. changes in temperature and precipitation will have especially severe impacts on already vulnerable hotspots technical summary identified in figure ts. in addition the frequency of occurrence of weather and climate extremes is likely to increase in the future as is the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the caribbean basin. under future climate change there is risk of significant species extinctions in many areas of tropical latin america high confidence. gradual replacement of tropical forest by savannas is expected by mid century in eastern amazonia and the tropical forests of central and southern mexico along with replacement of semi arid by arid vegetation in parts of north east brazil and most of central and northern mexico due to increases in temperature and associated decreases in soil water high confidence. by the of agricultural lands are very likely to be subjected to desertification and salinisation in some areas high confidence. there is risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many areas of tropical latin america. seven out of the world twenty five most critical places with high endemic species concentrations are in latin america and these areas are undergoing habitat loss. biological reserves and ecological corridors have been either implemented or planned for the maintenance of biodiversity in natural ecosystems and these can serve as adaptation measures to help protect ecosystems in the face of climate change. by the the net increase in the number of people experiencing water stress due to climate change is likely to be between and million medium confidence. for the second half of the st century the potential water availability reduction and the increasing demand from an increasing regional population would increase these figures to between and million. generalised reductions in rice yields by the as well as increases in soybean yields in temperate zones are likely when co effects are considered medium confidence. for other crops wheat maize the projected response to climate change is more erratic depending on the chosen scenario. assuming low co fertilisation effects the number of additional people at risk of hunger under the scenario is likely to reach and million in and respectively medium confidence. livestock and dairy productivity is likely to decline in response to increasing temperatures. the expected increases in sea level rise weather and climatic variability and extremes are very likely to affect coastal areas high confidence. during the last to years the rate of sea level rise increased from to mm year in south eastern south america. in the future sea level rise is projected to cause an increased risk of flooding in low lying areas. key hotspots for latin america where climate change impacts are expected to be particularly severe. however the effectiveness of these efforts is outweighed by lack of capacity building and appropriate political institutional and technological frameworks low income and settlements in vulnerable areas among others. otherwise the latin american countries sustainable development goals are likely to be seriously compromised adversely affecting among other things their capability to reach the millennium development goals. north america north america has considerable adaptive capacity which has been deployed effectively at times but this capacity has not always protected its population from adverse impacts of climate variability and extreme weather events very high confidence. damage and loss of life from hurricane katrina in august illustrate the limitations of existing adaptive capacity to extreme events. traditions and institutions in north america have encouraged decentralised response framework where adaptation tends to be reactive unevenly distributed and focused on coping with rather than preventing problems. emphasis on effective adaptation is critical because economic damage from extreme weather is likely to continue increasing with direct and indirect consequences of climate change playing growing role very high confidence. over the past several decades economic damage from hurricanes in north america has increased over fourfold figure ts due largely to an increase in the value of infrastructure at risk. costs to north america include billions of dollars in damaged property and diminished economic productivity as well as lives disrupted and lost. hardships from extreme events affect those who are socially and economically disadvantaged especially the poor and indigenous peoples of north america. climate change is likely to exacerbate other stresses on infrastructure and human health and safety in urban centres very high confidence. climate change impacts in urban centres are very likely to be compounded by urban heat islands air and water pollution ageing infrastructure maladapted urban form and building stock water quality and supply challenges immigration and population growth and an ageing population. coastal communities and habitats are very likely to be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution very high confidence. sea level is rising along much of the coast and the rate of change is likely to increase in the future exacerbating the impacts of progressive inundation storm surge flooding and shoreline erosion. storm impacts are likely to be more severe especially along the gulf and atlantic coasts. salt marshes other coastal habitats and dependent species are threatened now and increasingly in future decades by sea level rise fixed structures blocking landward migration and changes in vegetation. population growth and rising value of infrastructure in coastal areas increases vulnerability to climate variability and future climate change with losses projected to increase if the intensity of tropical storms increases. current adaptation to coastal hazards is uneven and readiness for increased exposure is low. warm temperatures and extreme weather already cause adverse human health effects through heat related mortality pollution storm related fatalities and injuries and infectious diseases and are likely in the absence of effective countermeasures to increase with climate change very high confidence. climate change is very likely to constrain north america already intensively utilised water resources interacting with other stresses high confidence. diminishing snowpack and increasing evaporation due to rising temperatures are very likely to affect timing and availability of water and intensify competition among uses. warming is very likely to place additional stress on groundwater availability compounding

land use and development affecting the future of wildland ecosystems high confidence. recent climate trends have increased ecosystem net primary production and this trend is likely to continue for the next few decades. however wildfire and insect outbreaks are increasing trend that is likely to intensify in warmer future. over the course of the st century the tendency for species and ecosystems to shift northward and to higher elevations is likely to rearrange the map of north american ecosystems. polar regions the environmental impacts of climate change show profound regional differences both within and between the polar regions very high confidence. the impacts of climate change in the arctic over the next hundred years are likely to exceed the changes forecast for many other regions. however the complexity of responses in biological and human systems and the fact that they are subject to additive multiple stresses means that the impacts of climate change on these systems remain difficult to predict. changes on the antarctic peninsula sub antarctic islands and southern ocean have also been rapid and in future dramatic impacts are expected. evidence of ongoing change over the rest of the antarctic continent is less conclusive and prediction of the likely impacts is thus difficult. for both polar regions economic impacts are especially difficult to address due to the lack of available information. there is growing evidence of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems in both polar regions high confidence. there has been measured change in composition and range of plants and animals on the antarctic peninsula and on the sub antarctic islands. there is documented increase in the overall greenness of parts of the arctic an increase in biological productivity change in species ranges shifts from tundra to shrublands some changes in position of the northern limit of trees and changes in the range and abundance of some animal species. in both the arctic and antarctic research indicates that such changes in biodiversity and vegetation zone relocation will continue. the poleward migration of existing species and competition from invading species is already occurring and will continue to alter species composition and abundance in terrestrial and aquatic systems associated vulnerabilities are related to loss of biodiversity and the spread of animal transmitted diseases. the continuation of hydrological and cryospheric changes will have significant regional impacts onarctic freshwater riparian and near shore marine systems high confidence. the combined discharge of eurasian rivers draining into thearctic ocean shows an increase since the largely consistent with increased precipitation although changes to cryospheric processes snowmelt and permafrost thaw are also modifying routing and seasonality of flow. the retreat of arctic sea ice over recent decades has led to improved marine access changes in coastal ecology biological production adverse effects on many ice dependent marine mammals and increased coastal wave action high confidence. continued loss of sea ice will produce regional opportunities and problems reductions in freshwater ice will affect lake and river ecology and biological production and will require changes in water based transportation. around theantarctic peninsula newly documented decline in krill abundance together with an increase in salp abundance has been attributed to regional reduction in the extent and duration of sea ice medium confidence. if there is further decline in sea ice further decline in krill is likely impacting predators higher up the food chain. warming of areas of the northern polar oceans has had negative impact on community composition biomass and distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton medium confidence. the impact of present and future changes on higher predators fish and fisheries will be regionally specific with some beneficial and some detrimental effects. many arctic human communities are already adapting to climate change high confidence. indigenous people have exhibited resilience to changes in their local environments for thousands of years. however stresses in addition to climate change together with migration into small remote communities and increasing involvement in employment economies and sedentary occupations will challenge adaptive capacity and increase vulnerability. the benefits will depend on particular local conditions but will in places include reduced heating costs increased agricultural and forestry opportunities more navigable northern sea routes and marine access to resources. the impacts of future climate change in the polar regions will produce feedbacks that will have globally significant consequences over the next hundred years high confidence. technical summary acontinued loss of land based ice will add to global sea level rise. amajor impact could result from weakening of the thermohaline circulation due to net increase in river flow into thearctic ocean and the resulting increased flux of freshwater into the north atlantic. under co doubling total river flow into the arctic ocean is likely to increase by up to. warming will expose more bare ground in thearctic figure ts and on theantarctic peninsula to be colonised by vegetation. recent models predict decrease in albedo due to loss of ice and changing vegetation and that the tundra will be small sink for carbon although increased methane emissions from the thawing permafrost could contribute to climate warming. small islands small islands have characteristics which make them especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change sea level rise and extreme events very high confidence. sea level rise is likely to exacerbate inundation storm surge erosion and other coastal hazards thus threatening the vital infrastructure that supports the socio economic well being of island communities very high confidence. some studies suggest that sea level rise could cause coastal land loss and inundation while others show that some islands are mor phologically resilient and are expected to persist. in the caribbean and pacific islands more than of the population live within km of the shore. almost without exception the air and sea ports major road arteries communication networks utili ties and other critical infrastructure in the small islands of the indian and pacific oceans and the caribbean tend to be restricted to coastal locations table ts. the threat from sea level rise is likely to be amplified by changes in tropical cyclones. there is strong evidence that under most climate change sce narios water resources in small islands are likely to be seri ously compromised very high confidence. many small is lands in the caribbean and pacific are likely to experience in creased water stress as result of climate change. predictions under all sres scenarios for this region show reduced rainfall in summer so that it is unlikely that demand will be met during low rainfall periods. increased rainfall in winter will be un likely to compensate due to lack of storage and high runoff dur ing storms. climate change is likely to heavily impact coral reefs fisheries and other marine based resources high confidence. fisheries make an important contribution to the gdp of many island states. changes in the occurrence and intensity of el ni\xf1o southern oscillation enso events are likely to have severe impacts on commercial and artisanal fisheries. increasing sea surface temperature and sea level

arctic and neighbouring regions. top present day based on floristic surveys. bottom modelled for under the is emissions scenario. on some islands especially those at higher latitudes warming has already led to the replacement of some local species high confidence. mid and high latitude islands are virtually certain to be colonised by non indigenous invasive species previously limited by unfavourable temperature conditions see table ts. increases in extreme events in the short term are virtually certain to affect the adaptation responses of forests on tropical islands where regeneration is often slow. in view of their small area forests on many islands can easily be decimated by violent cyclones or storms. on some high latitude islands it is likely that forest cover will increase. it is very likely that subsistence and commercial agriculture on small islands will be adversely affected by climate change high confidence. sea level rise inundation sea water intrusion into freshwater lenses soil salinisation and decline in water supply will very likely adversely impact coastal agriculture away from the coast changes in extremes flooding and drought are likely to have negative effect on agricultural production appropriate adaptation measures may help to reduce these impacts. in some high latitude islands new opportunities may arise for increased agricultural production. new studies confirm previous findings that the effects of climate change on tourism are likely to be direct and indirect and largely negative high confidence. tourism is the major contributor to gdp and employment in many small islands. in addition loss of cultural heritage from inundation and flooding will reduce the amenity value for coastal users. whereas warmer climate could reduce the number of people visiting small islands in low latitudes it could have the reverse effect in mid and high latitude islands. there is growing concern that global climate change is likely to impact human health mostly in adverse ways medium confidence. outbreaks of climate sensitive diseases can be costly in terms of lives and economic impact. increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability due to climate change are likely to increase the burdens of diarrhoeal and other infectious diseases in some small island states. range of future impacts and

immediate especially if they also address vulnerabilities to current climate conditions. given these differences between adaptation and mitigation climate policy is not about making choice between adapting to and mitigating climate change. if key vulnerabilities to climate change are to be addressed adaptation is necessary because even the most stringent mitigation efforts cannot avoid further

vulnerabilities and risks reduced for different amounts of emissions reduction. in addition more quantitative information is now available concerning when over range of temperature increases given amounts of impact may occur. this allows inference of the amounts of global temperature increase that are associated with given impacts. table ts illustrates the change in global average temperature projected for three periods for several alternative stabilisation pathways and for emissions trends assumed under different sres scenarios. reference to tables ts and ts provides picture of the impacts which might be avoided for given ranges of temperature change. portfolio of adaptation and mitigation measures can diminish the risks associated with climate change. even the most stringent mitigation efforts cannot avoid further impacts of climate change in the next few decades which makes adaptation essential particularly in addressing near term impacts. unmitigated climate change would in the long term be likely to exceed the capacity of natural managed and human systems to adapt. this suggests the value of portfolio or mix of strategies that includes mitigation adaptation technological development to enhance both adaptation and mitigation and research on climate science impacts adaptation and mitigation. such portfolios could combine policies with incentive based approaches and actions at all levels from the individual citizen through to national governments and international organisations. these actions include technological institutional and behavioural options the introduction of economic and policy instruments to encourage the use of these options and research and development to reduce uncertainty and to enhance the options effectiveness and efficiency. many different actors are involved in the implementation of these actions operating on different spatial and institutional scales. adaptive capacity to multiple stressors in india the capacity to adapt to climate change is not evenly distributed across or within nations. in india for example both climate change and trade liberalisation are changing the context for agricultural production. some farmers are able to adapt to these changing conditions including discrete events such as drought and rapid changes in commodity prices but others are not. identifying the areas where both processes are likely to have negative outcomes provides first step in identifying options and constraints in adapting to changing conditions. figure ts shows regional vulnerability to climate change measured as composite of adaptive capacity and climate sensitivity under exposure to climate change. the superimposed hatching indicates those areas which are doubly exposed through high vulnerability to climate change and high vulnerability to trade liberalisation. the results of this mapping show higher degrees of resilience in districts located along the indo gangetic plains except in the state of bihar the south and east and lower resilience in the interior parts of the country particularly in the states of bihar rajasthan madhya pradesh maharashtra andhra pradesh and karnataka. districts in india that rank highest in terms of vulnerability to climate change and import competition associated with economic globalisation are considered to be double exposed depicted with hatching. one way of increasing adaptive capacity is by introducing the consideration of climate change impacts in development planning for example by including adaptation measures in land use planning and infrastructure design including measures to reduce vulnerability in existing disaster risk reduction strategies. decisions on adaptation and mitigation are taken at range of different levels. effective mitigation requires the participation of the bulk of major greenhouse gas emitters globally whereas most adaptation takes place at local and national levels. consequently mitigation is primarily driven by international agreements and the ensuing national public policies whereas most adaptation is driven by private actions of affected entities and public arrangements of impacted communities. between adaptation and mitigation can exist at each level of decision making. an example of an adaptation action with negative mitigation effect is the use of air conditioning if the required energy is provided by fossil fuels. an example of mitigation action with positive adaptation effect could be the afforestation of degraded hill slopes which would not only sequester carbon but also control soil erosion. other examples of such synergies between adaptation and mitigation include rural electrification based on renewable energy sources planting trees in cities to reduce the heat island effect and the development of agroforestry systems. analysis of the between adaptation and mitigation may reveal ways to promote the effective implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions. creating synergies between adaptation and mitigation can increase the cost effectiveness of actions and make them more attractive to potential funders and other decision makers see table ts. however synergies provide no guarantee that resources are used in the most efficient manner when seeking to reduce the risks of climate change. opportunities for synergies exist in some sectors agriculture forestry buildings and urban infrastructure but they are rather limited in many other climate relevant sectors. lack of both conceptual and empirical information that explicitly considers both adaptation and mitigation makes it difficult to assess the need for and potential of synergies in climate policy. decisions on trade offs between the immediate localised benefits of adaptation and the longer term global benefits of mitigation would require information on the actions costs and benefits over time. intricacies of the between adaptation and mitigation become apparent at the more detailed analytical and implementation levels. these intricacies including the fact that adaptation and mitigation operate on different spatial temporal and institutional scales and involve different actors who have different interests and different beliefs value systems and property rights present challenge to the practical implementation of trade offs beyond the local scale. in particular the notion of an optimal mix of adaptation and mitigation is problematic since it usually assumes that there is zero sum budget for adaptation and mitigation and that it would be possible to capture the individual interests of all who will be affected by climate change now and in the future into global aggregate measure of well being. technical summary scale adaptation mitigation

than specific adaptation responses are required. sensitivity of climate models to forcing they nevertheless provide indications of damages avoided or vulnerabilities and risks reduced for different amounts of emissions reduction. in addition more quantitative information is now available concerning when over range of temperature increases given amounts of impact may occur. this allows inference of the amounts of global temperature increase that are associated with given impacts. table ts illustrates the change in global average temperature projected for three periods for several alternative stabilisation pathways and for emissions trends assumed under different sres scenarios. reference to tables ts and ts provides picture of the impacts which might be avoided for given ranges of temperature change. portfolio of adaptation and mitigation measures can diminish the risks associated with climate change. even the most stringent mitigation efforts cannot avoid further impacts of climate change in the next few decades which makes adaptation essential particularly in addressing near term impacts. unmitigated climate change would in the long term be likely to exceed the capacity of natural managed and human systems to adapt. this suggests the value of portfolio or mix of strategies that includes mitigation adaptation technological development to enhance both adaptation and mitigation and research on climate science impacts adaptation and mitigation. such portfolios could combine policies with incentive based approaches and actions at all levels from the individual citizen through to national governments and international organisations. these actions include technological institutional and behavioural options the introduction of economic and policy instruments to encourage the use of these options and research and development to reduce uncertainty and to enhance the options effectiveness and efficiency. many different actors are involved in the implementation of these actions operating on different spatial and institutional scales. adaptive capacity to multiple stressors in india the capacity to adapt to climate change is not evenly distributed across or within nations. in india for example both climate change and trade liberalisation are changing the context for agricultural production. some farmers are able to adapt to these changing conditions including discrete events such as drought and rapid changes in commodity prices but others are not. identifying the areas where both processes are likely to have negative outcomes provides first step in identifying options and constraints in adapting to changing conditions. figure ts shows regional vulnerability to climate change measured as composite of adaptive capacity and climate sensitivity under exposure to climate change. the superimposed hatching indicates those areas which are doubly exposed through high vulnerability to climate change and high vulnerability to trade liberalisation. districts in india that rank highest in terms of vulnerability to climate change and import competition associated with economic globalisation are considered to be double exposed depicted with hatching. one way of increasing adaptive capacity is by introducing the consideration of climate change impacts in development planning for example by including adaptation measures in land use planning and infrastructure design including measures to reduce vulnerability in existing disaster risk reduction strategies. decisions on adaptation and mitigation are taken at range of different levels. effective mitigation requires the participation of the bulk of major greenhouse gas emitters globally whereas most adaptation takes place at local and national levels. the benefits of mitigation are global whilst its costs and ancillary benefits arise locally. both the costs and benefits of adaptation mostly accrue locally. consequently mitigation is primarily driven by international agreements and the ensuing national public policies whereas most adaptation is driven by private actions of affected entities and public arrangements of impacted communities. between adaptation and mitigation can exist at each level of decision making. an example of an adaptation action with negative mitigation effect is the use of air conditioning if the required energy is provided by fossil fuels. an example of mitigation action with positive adaptation effect could be the afforestation of degraded hill slopes which would not only sequester carbon but also control soil erosion. other examples of such synergies between adaptation and mitigation include rural electrification based on renewable energy sources planting trees in cities to reduce the heat island effect and the development of agroforestry systems. analysis of the between adaptation and mitigation may reveal ways to promote the effective implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions. creating synergies between adaptation and mitigation can increase the cost effectiveness of actions and make them more attractive to potential funders and other decision makers see table ts. however synergies provide no guarantee that resources are used in the most efficient manner when seeking to reduce the risks of climate change. moreover essential actions without synergetic effects may be overlooked if the creation of synergies becomes dominant decision criterion. opportunities for synergies exist in some sectors agriculture forestry buildings and urban infrastructure but they are rather limited in many other climate relevant sectors. lack of both conceptual and empirical information that explicitly considers both adaptation and mitigation makes it difficult to assess the need for and potential of synergies in climate policy. decisions on trade offs between the immediate localised benefits of adaptation and the longer term global benefits of mitigation would require information on the actions costs and benefits over time. for example relevant question would be whether or not investment in adaptation would buy time for mitigation. intricacies of the between adaptation and mitigation become apparent at the more detailed analytical and implementation levels. these intricacies including the fact that adaptation and mitigation operate on different spatial temporal and institutional scales and involve different actors who have different interests and different beliefs value systems and property rights present challenge to the practical implementation of trade offs beyond the local scale. in particular the notion of an optimal mix of adaptation and mitigation is problematic since it usually assumes that there is zero sum budget for adaptation and mitigation and that it would be possible to capture the individual interests of all who will be affected by climate change now and in the future into global aggregate measure of well being. technical summary scale

climate change will erode nations capacities to achieve the goals calibrated in terms of reducing poverty and otherwise improving equity by particularly in africa and parts of asia very high confidence. even though there are cases where climate related extreme events have severely interfered with economic development it is very unlikely that climate change attributed to anthropogenic sources per se will be significant extra impediment to most nations reaching their millennium development targets. many other obstacles with more immediate impacts stand in the way. sustainable development can reduce vulnerability to climate change by encouraging adaptation enhancing adaptive capacity and increasing resilience very high confidence. on the other hand it is very likely that climate change can slow the pace of progress toward sustainable development either directly through increased exposure to adverse impact or indirectly through erosion of the capacity to adapt. this point is clearly demonstrated in the sections of the sectoral and regional chapters of this report that discuss implications for sustainable development see section in chapters to. at present few plans for promoting sustainability have explicitly included either adapting to climate change impacts or promoting adaptive capacity. efforts to cope with the impacts of climate change and attempts to promote sustainable development share common goals and determinants including access to resources including information and technology equity in the distribution of resources stocks of human and social capital access to risk sharing mechanisms and abilities of decision support mechanisms to cope with uncertainty. it is very likely that significant synergies can be exploited in bringing climate change to the development community and critical development issues to the climate change community and. effective communication in assessment appraisal and action are likely to be important tools both in participatory assessment and governance as well as in identifying productive areas for shared learning initiatives. despite these synergies few discussions about promoting sustainability have thus far explicitly included adapting to climate impacts reducing hazard risks and or promoting adaptive capacity. discussions about promoting development and improving environmental quality have seldom explicitly included adapting to climate impacts and or promoting adaptive capacity. most of the scholars and practitioners of development who recognise that climate change is significant issue at local national regional and or global levels focus their attention almost exclusively on mitigation. synergies between adaptation and mitigation measures will be effective through the middle of this century but even combination of aggressive mitigation and significant investment in adaptive capacity could be overwhelmed by the end of the century along likely development scenario. tables ts and ts track major worldwide impacts for major sectors against temperature increases measured from the to period. with very high confidence no temperature threshold associated with any subjective judgment of what might constitute dangerous climate change can be guaranteed to be avoided by anything but the most stringent of mitigation interventions. as illustrated in figure ts it is likely that global mitigation efforts designed to cap effective greenhouse gas concentrations at for example ppm would benefit developing countries significantly through the middle of this century regardless of whether the climate sensitivity turns out to be high or low and especially when combined with enhanced adaptation. developed countries would also likely see significant benefits from an adaptation mitigation intervention portfolio especially for high climate sensitivities and in sectors and regions that are already showing signs of being vulnerable. by climate change will likely produce significant vulnerabilities across the globe even if aggressive mitigation were implemented in combination with significantly enhanced adaptive capacity. ts advances in knowledge and future research needs ts advances in knowledge since the ipcc third assessment the principal advances in knowledge have been as follows. much improved coverage of the impacts of climate change on developing regions through studies such as the aiacc project assessments of impacts and adaptations to climate change in multiple regions and sectors although further research is still required especially in latin america and africa es es es. more studies of adaptation to climate change with improved understanding of current practice adaptive capacity the options barriers and limits to adaptation es. much more monitoring of observed effects and recognition that climate change is having discernible impact on many natural systems es. some standardisation of the scenarios of future climate change underpinning impact studies facilitated by centralised data provision through organisations such as the ipcc data distribution centre thus allowing comparison between sectors and regions. improved understanding of the damages for different levels of global warming and the link between global warming technical summary and the probability of stabilising co at various levels. as result we know more about the link between damages and co stabilisation scenarios. however there has been little advance on impacts under different assumptions about how the world will evolve in future societies governance technology and economic development the costs of climate change both of the impacts and of response adaptation and mitigation proximity to thresholds and tipping points impacts resulting from interactions between climate change and other human induced environmental changes. ts future research needs impacts under different assumptions about future development pathways most ar studies of future climate change are based on small number of studies using sres scenarios especially the and families. this has allowed some limited but incomplete of the potential range of futures and their impacts see section on key future impacts in all core chapters. scenarios are required to describe the future evolution of the world under different and wide ranging assumptions about how societies governance technology economies will develop in future at the regional and local scales appropriate for impacts analysis which allow adaptation to be incorporated into climate change impact estimates for abrupt climate change such as the collapse of the north atlantic meridional overturning circulation and large sea level rises due to ice sheet melting for beyond especially for sea level rise. increasingly climate modellers run model ensembles which allow of the uncertainty range for each development pathway. thus the impacts analyst is faced with very large quantities of data to capture even small part of the potential range of futures. damages avoided by different levels of emissions reduction very few studies have been carried out to explore the damages avoided or the impacts postponed by reducing

the large reductions in damages which can be achieved by mitigating emissions. existing research has emphasised the global scale and studies which are disaggregated to the regional and even local scale are urgently required. climate science related research needs two of the most important requirements identified relate to research in climate change science but have been clearly identified as hindrance to research in impacts adaptation and vulnerability. the first is that our understanding of the likely future impacts of climate change is hampered by lack of knowledge regarding the nature of future changes particularly at the regional scale and particularly with respect to precipitation changes and their hydrological consequences on water resources and changes in extreme events due in part to the inadequacies of existing climate models at the required spatial scales. policy makers require understanding of the impacts of such events as the collapse of the north atlantic meridional overturning circulation. however without better understanding of the likely manifestation of such events at the regional scale it is not possible to carry out impacts assessments. observations monitoring and attribution large area long term field studies are required to evaluate observed impacts of climate change on managed and unmanaged systems and human activities. this will enable improved understanding of where and when impacts become detectable where the hotspots lie and why some areas are more vulnerable than others. high quality observations are essential for full understanding of causes and for unequivocal attribution of present day trends to climate change. timely monitoring of the pace of approaching significant thresholds such as abrupt climate change thresholds is required. multiple stresses thresholds and vulnerable people and places it has become clear in the ar that the impacts of climate change are most damaging when they occur in the context of multiple stresses arising from the effects for example of globalisation poverty poor governance and settlement of low lying coasts. considerable progress has been made towards understanding which people and which locations may expect to be impacted by the negative aspects of climate change. it is important to understand what characteristics enhance vulnerability what characteristics strengthen the adaptive capacity of some people and places and what characteristics predispose physical biological and human systems to irreversible changes as result of exposure to climate and other stresses es. how can systems be managed to minimise the risk of irreversible changes how close are we to tipping points thresholds for natural ecosystems such as the amazon rain forest what positive feedbacks would emerge if such tipping point is reached climate change adaptation and sustainable development the ar recognised that synergies exist between adaptive capacity and sustainable development and that societies which are pursuing path of sustainable development are likely to be more resilient to the impacts of climate change. further research is required to determine the factors which contribute to this synergy and how policies to enhance adaptive capacity can reinforce sustainable development and vice versa. further understanding of adaptation is likely to require learning by doing approaches where the knowledge base is enhanced through accumulation of practical experience. the costs of climate change both the costs of the impacts and of response adaptation and mitigation only small amount of literature on the costs of climate change impacts could be found for assessment. debate still surrounds the topic of how to measure impacts and which metrics should be used to ensure comparability. the literature on adaptation costs and benefits is limited and fragmented. it focuses on sea level rise and agriculture with more limited assessments for energy demand water resources and transport. there is an emphasis on the usa and other oecd countries with only few studies for developing countries. better understanding of the relative costs of climate change impacts

of chacaltaya and its effects case study of small disappearing glacier in bolivia the observed general glacier retreat in the warming tropical andes has increased significantly in recent decades francou et al. small sized glaciers are particularly vulnerable in warmer climates with many of them having already disappeared in several parts of the world during the last century. the chacaltaya glacier in bolivia is typical example of disappearing small glacier whose area in was km and which has currently reduced in to less than km figure ramirez et al francou et al berger et al with current estimates showing that it may disappear completely before. in the period to the glacier suffered loss of of its surface area and of its volume of ice berger et al. although in the tropics glacier mass balance responds sensitively to changes in precipitation and humidity see lemke et al section the fast glacier shrinkage of chacaltaya is consistent with an ascent of the isotherm of about decade in the tropical andes since the vuille et al resulting in corresponding rise in the equilibrium line of glaciers in the region coudrain et al. ice melt from chacaltaya glacier located in choqueyapu basin provides part of the water resources for the nearby city of la paz allowing the release of water stored as ice throughout the long dry winter season april september. many basins in the tropical andes

lakes still exist in the himalayas yamada and the andes ames together with several more in other mountain ranges of the world. the temporary increase in glacier melt can also produce enhanced glofs as has been reported in chile pe\xf1a and escobar although these have not been linked with any long term climate trends. enhanced colonisation of plants and animals in deglaciated terrain is direct effect of glacier and snow retreat jones and henry. although changes due to other causes such as introduction by human activities increased uv radiation contaminants and habitat loss might be important frenot et al greening has been reported in relation to warming in thearctic and also in theantarctic peninsula. tundra areas in the northern circumpolar high latitudes derived from year satellite record show greening trends while forest areas show declines in photosynthetic activity bunn and goetz. glacier retreat causes striking changes in the landscape which has affected living conditions and local tourism in many mountain regions around the world watson and haeberli m\xf6lg et al. warming produces an enhanced spring summer melting of glaciers particularly in areas of ablation with corresponding loss of seasonal snow cover that results in an increased exposure of surface crevasses which can in turn affect for example snow runway operations as has been reported in the antarctic peninsula rivera et al. the retreat enhanced flow and collapse of glaciers ice streams and ice shelves can lead to increased production of iceberg calving which can in turn affect sea navigation although no evidence for this exists as yet. snow cover spring peak river flows have been occurring weeks earlier during the last years in north america and northern eurasia. there is also evidence for an increase in winter base flow in northern eurasia and north america. these changes in river runoff are described in detail in section and table. there is also measured trend towards less snow at low altitudes which is affecting skiing areas table. frozen ground degradation of seasonally frozen ground and permafrost and an increase in active layer thickness should result in an increased importance of surface water mcnamara et al with an initial but temporary phase of lake expansion due to melting followed by their disappearance due to draining within the permafrost as has been detected in alaska yoshikawa and hinzman and in siberia smith et al. permafrost and frozen ground degradation are resulting in an increased areal extent of wetlands in the arctic with an associated greening plant colonisation see above. permafrost degradation and wetland increase might produce an increased release of carbon in the form of methane to the atmosphere in the future lawrence and slater zimov et al but this has not been documented. the observed permafrost warming and degradation together with an increasing depth of the active layer should result in mechanical weakening of the ground and ground subsidence and formation of thermokarst will have weakening effect on existing infrastructure such as buildings roads airfields and pipelines couture et al nelson but there is no solid evidence for this yet. there is evidence for decrease in potential travel days of vehicles over frozen roads in alaska table. permafrost melting has produced increased coastal erosion in the arctic beaulieu and allard this is detailed in section. thawing and deepening of the active layer in high mountain areas can produce slope instability and rock falls watson and haeberli which in turn can trigger outburst floods casassa and marangunic carey but there is no evidence for trends. reported case linked to warming is the exceptional rock fall activity in the alps during the summer heatwave table. sea ice nutritional stresses related to longer ice free seasons in the beaufort sea may be inducing declining survival rates smaller size and cannibalism among polar bears amstrup et al regehr et al. polar bears are entirely dependent on sea ice as platform to access the marine mammals that provide their nutritional needs amstrup. reduced sea ice in the arctic will probably result in increased navigation partial evidence of which has already been found eagles and possibly also rise in offshore oil operations with positive effects such as enhanced trade and negative ones such as increased pollution chapter acia but there are no quantitative data to support this. increased navigability in the arctic should also raise issues of water sovereignty versus international access for shipping through the north west and north east passages. previously uncharted islands and seamounts have been discovered due to reduction in sea ice cover mohr and forsberg which can be relevant for territorial and ocean claims. ocean freshening circulation and ecosystems there is evidence for freshening in the north atlantic and in the ross sea which is probably linked to glacier melt bindoff et al. there is no significant evidence of changes in the meridional overturning circulation at high latitudes in the north atlantic ocean or in the southern ocean although important changes in interannual to decadal scales have been observed in the north atlantic bindoff et al. ocean ecosystem impacts such as reduction of krill biomass and an increase in salps in

reported since the tar. the time period under consideration is primarily to with many studies extending to earlier decades. observed changes in precipitation and aspects of surface hydrology are described in more detail by trenberth et al. changes in surface and groundwater systems since the tar there have been many studies related to trends in river flows during the th century at scales ranging from catchment to global. some of these studies have detected significant trends in some indicators of river flow and some have demonstrated statistically significant links with trends in temperature or precipitation but no globally homogeneous trend has been reported. many studies however have found no trends or have been unable to separate the effects of variations in temperature and precipitation from the effects of human interventions in the catchment such as land use change and reservoir construction. variation in river flows from year to year is also very strongly influenced in some regions by large scale atmospheric circulation patterns associated with enso nao and other variability systems that operate at within decadal and multi decadal time scales. at the global scale there is evidence of broadly coherent pattern of change in annual runoff with some regions experiencing an increase at higher latitudes and decrease in parts of west africa southern europe and southern latin america milly et al. claimed increase in global total runoff per rise in temperature during the th century with regional variation around this trend but this has been challenged legates et al due to the effects of non climatic drivers on runoff and bias due to the small number of data points. the methodology used to search for trends can also influence results since omitting the effects of cross correlation between river catchments can lead to an overestimation of the number of catchments showing significant trends douglas et al. runoff in snow basins there is abundant evidence for an earlier occurrence of spring peak river flows and an increase in winter base flow in basins with important seasonal snow cover in north america and northern eurasia in agreement with local and regional climate warming in these areas table. the early spring shift in runoff leads to shift in peak river runoff away from summer and autumn which are normally the seasons with the highest water demand resulting in consequences for water availability see chapter. groundwater groundwater in shallow aquifers is part of the hydrological cycle and is affected by climate variability

changes in physical and chemical aspects of lakes and rivers changes in thermal structure and chemistry have been documented in many parts of the world in recent decades. thermal structure higher water temperatures have been reported in lakes in response to warmer conditions table see table sm for additional changes in physical water properties. shorter periods of ice cover and decreases in river and lake ice thickness are treated in section and le treut et al. phytoplankton dynamics and primary productivity have also been altered in conjunction with changes in lake physics see section figure table. since the surface water temperatures have warmed by to in lakes and rivers in europe north america and asia. along with warming surface waters deep water temperatures which reflect long term trends of the large east african lakes edward albert kivu victoria tanganyika and malawi have warmed by to since the early. increased water temperature and longer ice free seasons influence the thermal stratification and internal hydrodynamics of lakes. in warmer years surface water temperatures are higher evaporative water loss increases summer stratification occurs earlier in the season and thermoclines become shallower. in several lakes in europe and north america the stratified period has advanced by up to days and lengthened by to weeks with increased thermal stability. chemistry increased stratification reduces water movement across the thermocline inhibiting the upwelling and mixing that provide essential nutrients to the food web. there have been decreases in nutrients in the surface water and corresponding increases in deep water concentrations of european and east african lakes because of reduced upwelling due to greater thermal stability. in contrast when warmer temperatures enhanced vegetative growth and soil development in some high alpine ecosystems alkalinity decreased because of increased organic acid inputs karst riddoch et al. glacial melting increased the input of organochlorines which had been atmospherically transported to and stored in the glacier to sub alpine lake in canada blais et al. increased temperature also affects in lake chemical processes table also see table sm for additional observed changes in chemical water properties. there have been decreases in dissolved inorganic nitrogen from greater phytoplankton productivity sommaruga wograth et al rogora et al and greater in lake alkalinity generation and increases in ph in soft water lakes psenner and schmidt. decreased solubility from higher temperatures significantly contributed to to of the decrease in aluminium concentration vesely et al whereas lakes that had warmer water temperatures had increased mercury methylation and higher mercury levels in fish bodaly et al. decrease in silicon content related to regional warming has been documented in lake baikal russia. river water quality data from rivers in japan also suggest deterioration in both chemical and biological features due to increases in air temperature. summary of hydrology and water resources changes in river discharge as well as in droughts and heavy rains in some regions indicate that hydrological conditions have become more intense. some local trends in reduced groundwater and lake levels have been reported but these are likely to be due to human activities rather than climate change. climate change signals related to increasing runoff and streamflow have been observed over the last century in many regions particularly in basins fed by glaciers permafrost and snow melt. evidence includes increases in average runoff of arctic rivers in eurasia which has been at least partly correlated with climate warming and earlier spring snow melt and increase in winter base flow in north america and eurasia due to enhanced seasonal snow melt associated with climate warming. lake formation and their subsequent disappearance in permafrost have been reported in the arctic.

zones many coastal regions are already experiencing the effects of relative local sea level rise from combination of climate induced sea level rise geological and anthropogenic induced land subsidence and other local factors. major challenge however is to separate the different meteorological oceanographic geophysical and anthropogenic processes affecting the shoreline in order to identify and isolate the contribution of global warming. an unambiguous attribution of current sea level rise as primary driver of shoreline change is difficult to determine at present. global sea level has been rising at rate of about to mm yr over the last century with an increased rate of about mm yr during the last decade church et al holgate and woodworth church and white bindoff et al section. changes in coastal geomorphology sea level rise over the last to years is probably contributing to coastal erosion in many places such as the east coast of the usa where of the shoreline removed from the influence of spits tidal inlets and engineering structures is eroding leatherman et al daniel zhang et al table see table sm for observations of changes in storm surges flood height and areas and waves. over the last century of the eastern coastline of the uk has retreated landward of the low water mark taylor et al. in addition to sea level change coastal erosion is driven by other natural factors such as wave energy sediment supply or local land subsidence stive. climate variability also affects shoreline processes as documented by shoreline displacement in estonia associated with increasing severe storms and high surge levels milder winters and reduced sea ice cover orviku et al. significant sections of glacially rebounding coastlines which normally would be accreting are nonetheless eroding as for example along hudson bay canada beaulieu and allard. reduction in sea ice cover due to milder winters has also exacerbated coastal erosion as in the gulf of st. degradation and melting of permafrost due to climate warming are also contributing to the rapid retreat of arctic coastlines in many regions such as the beaufort and laptev sea coasts forbes. much of the observed erosion is associated with shoreline development clearing of mangroves thampanya et al and mining of beach sand and coral. many of these marshes have had long history of anthropogenic modification including dredging and filling bulkheading and channelisation which in turn could have contributed to sediment starvation eutrophication and ultimately marsh submergence donnelly and bertness bertness et al. in europe losses have been documented in south east england between and although the rate of loss has slowed since cooper et al elsewhere there is evidence that not all coastal wetlands are retreating for example in normandy france haslett et al. although natural accretion rates of mangroves generally compensate for current rates of sea level rise of greater concern at present are the impacts of clearance for agriculture aquaculture particularly shrimp forestry and urbanisation. at least of the world mangrove forests have been removed in the last two decades but possible sea level rise effects were not considered valiela et al. in south eastern australia mangrove encroachment inland into salt marsh environments is probably related to anthropogenic causes and climate variability rather than sea level rise saintilan and williams. landward replacement of grassy freshwater marshes by more salt tolerant mangroves in the south eastern florida everglades since the has been attributed to the combined effects of sea level rise and water management resulting in lowered watertables ross et al. sea level rise can have larger impact on wetland ecosystems when the human land use pressure in the coastal area is large coasts defended by dykes and urbanisation. changes in storm surges flood heights and areas and waves the vulnerability of the coastal zone to storm surges and waves depends on land subsidence changes in storminess and sea level rise see supplementary material. along the north american east coast although there has been no significant long term change in storm climatology storm surge impacts have increased due to regional sea level rise zhang et al. gulf coast is particularly vulnerable to hurricane surges due to low elevation and relative sea level

productivity and its contributing factors see section for phenological aspects. rising atmospheric co concentration lengthening of the growing season due to warming nitrogen deposition and changed management have resulted in steady increase in annual forest co storage capacity in the past few decades which has led to more significant net carbon uptake nabuurs et al. satellite derived estimates of global net primary production from satellite data of vegetation indexes indicate increase from to with large increases in tropical ecosystems nemani et al figure. also using satellite data confirm that the northern hemisphere vegetation activity has increased in magnitude by in eurasia and by in north america from to. thus the overall trend towards longer growing seasons is consistent with an increase in the greenness of vegetation for broadly continuous regions in eurasia and in more fragmented way in north america reflecting changes in biological activity. analyses in china attribute increases in net primary productivity in part to country wide lengthening of the growing season fang and dingbo. similarly other studies find decrease of days in the frost period in northern china

growth of mature beech trees at the lower limit of this species compared with those at higher altitudes. growth at the lower fagus limit was characterised by rapid recent decline starting in

warming temperatures. for north america recent observations from satellite imagery for the period to document decline for substantial portion of northern forest possibly related to warmer and longer summers whereas tundra productivity is continuing to increase goetz et al. they also confirm other results about the effects of droughts lotsch et al as well those made by ground measurements arrigo et al wilmking et al. climate warming can also change the disturbance regime of forests by extending the range of some damaging insects as observed during the last years for bark beetles in the usa williams and liebhold or pine processionary moth in europe battisti et al. trends in disturbance resulting from forest fires are still subject of controversy. in spite of current management practices that tend to reduce fuel load in forests climate variability is often the dominant factor affecting large wildfires given the presence of ignition sources mckenzie et al. this is confirmed by an analysis of forest fires in siberia between and conard et al which detected the significant impacts of two large fires in and resulting in million ha burned and to of the annual global carbon emissions from forest fires. the increase in outdoor fires in england and wales between and may be attributable to trend towards warmer and drier summer conditions cannell et al. repeated large forest fires during the warm season in recent years in the mediterranean region and north africa as well as in california have also been linked to drought episodes. one study of forest fires in canada gillett et al found that about half of the observed increase in burnt area during the last years in spite of improved fire fighting techniques is in agreement with simulated warming from general circulation model gcm. this finding is not fully supported by another study which found that fire frequency in canada has recently decreased in response to better fire protection and that the effects of climate change on fire activity are complex bergeron et al. however it seems to be confirmed by another recent study westerling et al which established dramatic and sudden increase in large wildfire activity in the western usa in the mid closely associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snow melt. summary of agriculture and forestry trends in individual climate variables or their combination into agro climatic indicators show that there is an advance in phenology in large parts of north america and europe which has been attributed to recent regional warming. in temperate regions there are clear signals of reduced risk of frost longer growing season duration increased biomass higher quality for grapevines climate sensitive crop insect expansion and increased forest fire occurrence that are in agreement with regional warming. these effects are hard to detect in aggregate agricultural statistics because of the influence of non climate factors particularly where advances in technology confound responses to warming although the present effects are of limited economic consequence and appear to lie within the ability of the sectors to adapt both agriculture and forestry show vulnerability to recent extreme heat and drought events. these observed changes are primarily related to temperature trends and changes in temperature extremes and relate to range of infectious and non infectious disease outcomes. these relationships are difficult to separate from the effects of major climate variability systems such as enso which have been shown to be associated with the transmission and occurrence of diseases in certain locations kovats et al rodo et al. there is little evidence about the effects of observed climate change on health for two reasons the lack of long epidemiological or health related data series and the importance of non climate drivers in determining the distribution and intensity of human disease. studies that have quantified the effect of climate or weather on health outcomes are listed in table. there is wide range of driving forces that can affect and modify the impact of climate change on human health indicators. consideration of reported trends in given disease and the attribution to climate change needs to take into account three possible conditions. that the change in disease incidence is real and due to changes in important non climate determinants which include social factors such as human population density and behaviour housing facilities public health facilities water supply and general infrastructure waste management and vector control programmes use of land for food fuel and fibre supply and results of adaptation measures drug and insecticide use as well as changed insecticide and drug resistance in pathogens and vector species tillman et al githeko and woodward molyneux sutherst. changes in land use and land cover can affect the local climate and ecosystems and should be considered when linking climate and health patz et al. that the change in disease incidence is real and due to changes in climate factors once all non climate determinants have been considered and excluded as the main explanation see for example purse et al. that the change in disease incidence is not real but is only apparent due to changed reporting or may be due to changes in other apparent factors such as population growth or movement. chapter assessment of observed changes and responses in natural and managed systems",source_PDF:"./PDFs/2007 Impact,

sustainability in small scale arctic communities berman et al. larger scale aggregation and attribution to anthropogenic climate change larger scale aggregation offers insights into the relationships between the observed changes assessed in section and temperature by combining results from many studies over multiple systems and larger regions. aggregation through meta analysis is described next followed by joint attribution through climate model studies and synthesis of the observed changes described in section. larger scale aggregation this section evaluates studies that use techniques that aggregate from individual observations at sites to regional continental and global scales. the methods used in the various studies however need not be similar. the criteria for inclusion of studies in meta analysis are determined priori and rigorously followed to avoid investigator effect. several studies have examined the fingerprint of observed warming in recent decades on the phenology and distribution of plants and animal species using meta analyses root and schneider parmesan and yohe root et al. although the detailed results of these studies are different because they used different species and different methods they all conclude that significant impact of warming is already discernible in animal and plant populations at regional and continental scales in the northern hemisphere. one meta analysis parmesan and yohe of studies of more than species showed that recent biological trends matched the expected responses to warming. they estimated northward range shifts of km decade for northern range boundaries of species living in the northern hemisphere and advancement of spring events in northern hemisphere species by days decade. after examining over articles on climate change and wide array of species from around the globe another study found that studies fitted the criteria for inclusion in their meta analyses root et al. they focused on only those species showing significant change and found that about of the species showing change were changing in the direction expected with warming. the types of changes included species expanding their ranges polewards and higher in elevation and advances in the timing of spring events by about days decade over the last years. this number is larger than the days decade found by parmesan and yohe because those authors included both changing and not changing species in their analysis while root and co authors only included changing species. more recent meta analysis of bird arrival dates lehikoinen et al showed strong evidence of earlier arrival. of data series were significantly earlier and only significantly later for first arrival dates. the eu cost network analysis project had as its main objective the establishment of comprehensive european reference data set of phenological observations that could be used for climatological purposes particularly climate monitoring and the detection of changes see box. this has been performed using studies with climate models to assess observed changes in several different physical and biological systems. an assessment of the relationship between significant observed changes from section and significant regional temperature changes is presented in section. attributing regional temperature change it is likely that there has been substantial anthropogenic contribution to surface temperature increases averaged over each continent except antarctica since the middle of the th century hegerl et al section. statistically significant regional warming trends over the last and years are found in many regions of the globe spagnoli et al karoly and wu karoly and stott knutson et al zhang et assessment of observed changes and responses in natural and managed systems chapter al trenberth et al figure. attributing temperature changes on smaller than continental scales and over time scales of less than years is difficult due to low signal to noise ratios at those scales. attribution of the observed warming to anthropogenic forcing is easier at larger scales because averaging over larger regions reduces the natural variability more making it easier to distinguish between changes expected from different external forcings or between external forcing and climate variability. the influence of anthropogenic forcing has also been detected in various physical systems over the last years including increases in global oceanic heat content increases in sea level shrinking of alpine glaciers reductions in arctic sea ice extent and reductions in spring snow cover hegerl et al. one study demonstrated joint attribution by considering changes in wild animals and plants root et al. they found spring phenological data for northern hemisphere species from studies. the changes in the timing of these species spring events blooming are significantly associated with the changes in the actual temperatures recorded as near to the study site as possible and for the same years that the species were observed. if the temperature was warming and the species phenology was getting earlier in the year then the expected association would be negative which is what was found for the correlations between the species data and the actual temperatures figure. temperature data from the hadcm climate model were used to determine whether the changes in the actual temperatures with chapter assessment of observed changes and responses in natural and managed systems box. phenological responses to climate in europe the cost project the cost meta analysis project used very large phenological network of more than observational series of various phases in plant and animal species in european countries for the period to. the time series were systematically re analysed for trends in order to track and quantify phenological responses to changing climate. the advantage of this study is its inclusion of multiple verified nationally reported trends at single sites and or for selected species which individually may be biased towards predominant reporting of climate change induced impacts. overall the phenology of the species national series was responsive to temperature of the preceding month with spring summer phases advancing on average by days and leaf colouring fall being delayed by day. the aggregation of more than trends revealed clear signal across europe of changing spring phenology with of leaf unfolding and flowering records advancing significantly sig and only delayed sig figure. spring and summer exhibited clear advance by days decade in europe mean autumn trends were close to zero but suggested more of delay when the average trend per country was examined days decade. the cost results assessed the possible lack of evidence at continental scale as since about of spring summer phases were found to be advancing. the findings strongly support previous studies in europe confirming them as free from bias towards reporting global climate change impacts menzel et al. frequency distributions of trends in phenology in days year over to for plant species in european countries. which the phenological changes in species were associated were due to human or natural causes. modelled temperature data were derived for each species over the same years species was studied and for the grid box within which the study area was located. each species long term phenological record was correlated with the three differently forced temperatures derived for the location where the species was recorded. the agreement is quite poor between the phenological changes in species and modelled temperatures derived using only natural climatic forcing figure. stronger agreement occurs between the same phenological changes in species and temperatures modelled using only anthropogenic forcing figure. as expected the strongest agreement is with the modelled temperatures derived using both natural and anthropogenic combined forcings figure. while there is uncertainty in downscaling the model simulated temperature changes to the areas that would affect the species being examined these results demonstrate some residual skills thereby allowing joint attribution to be shown. other similar studies have shown that the retreat of two glaciers in switzerland and norway cannot be explained by natural variability of climate and the glaciers alone reichert et al that observed global patterns of changes in streamflow are consistent with the response to anthropogenic climate change milly et al and that the observed increase in the area of forests burned in canada over the last four decades is consistent with the response due to anthropogenic climate change gillett et al. for example the analysis by reichert used climate model linked to local glacier mass balance model through downscaling and showed that the observed glacier retreat over the th century could not be explained by natural climate variability. however they did not show that the observed retreat was consistent with the response to anthropogenic climate change nor did they eliminate other possible factors such as changes in dust affecting the albedo of the glacier. similarly gillett and colleagues showed that the observed increases in area of forests burned was consistent with the response to anthropogenic forcing and not consistent with natural climate variability. synthesis of studies next synthesis of the significant observed changes described in section and the observed regional temperatures over the last three decades was performed. studies were selected that demonstrate statistically significant trend in change in systems related to temperature or other climate change variable as described by the authors for the period to study

temperatures derived for the location where the species was recorded. the agreement is quite poor between the phenological changes in species and modelled temperatures derived using only natural climatic forcing figure. stronger agreement occurs between the same phenological changes in species and temperatures modelled using only anthropogenic forcing figure. as expected the strongest agreement is with the modelled temperatures derived using both natural and anthropogenic combined forcings figure. while there is uncertainty in downscaling the model simulated temperature changes to the areas that would affect the species being examined these results demonstrate some residual skills thereby allowing joint attribution to be shown. other similar studies have shown that the retreat of two glaciers in switzerland and norway cannot be explained by natural variability of climate and the glaciers alone reichert et al that observed global patterns of changes in streamflow are consistent with the response to anthropogenic climate change milly et al and that the observed increase in the area of forests burned in canada over the last four decades is consistent with the response due to anthropogenic climate change gillett et al. each of these studies has its limitations for joint attribution. for example the analysis by reichert used climate model linked to local glacier mass balance model through downscaling and showed that the observed glacier retreat over the th century could not be explained by natural climate variability. however they did not show that the observed retreat was consistent with the response to anthropogenic climate change nor did they eliminate other possible factors such as changes in dust affecting the albedo of the glacier. similarly gillett and colleagues showed that the observed increases in area of forests burned was consistent with the response to anthropogenic forcing and not consistent with natural climate variability. however they did not consider changes in forest management as factor nor did they consider the climate response to other external forcing factors. taken together these studies show discernible influence of anthropogenic climate change on specific physical cryosphere hydrology and biological forestry and terrestrial biology systems. synthesis of studies next synthesis of the significant observed changes described in section and the observed regional temperatures over the last three decades was performed. significant observed changes documented since the tar were divided

learning from observed responses vulnerability adaptation and research needs the great majority of observed changes are consistent with functional understanding and modelled predictions of climate impacts. examples of expected responses include infrastructure effects of melting in the cryosphere effects of intensifying droughts and runoff and effects of rising sea levels. in marine freshwater and terrestrial biological systems changes in morphology physiology phenology reproduction species distribution community structure ecosystem processes and species evolutionary processes are for the most part in the predicted directions. agricultural crops have shown similar trends in phenology and management practices along with the spread of pests and diseases coincide with expected responses to warming. responses of yields in the few crops with reported changes coincide with model predictions. observed changes are prevalent across diverse physical and biological systems and less prevalent in managed systems and across many but not all geographical regions. while there is evidence of observed changes in every continent including antarctica much evidence comes from studies of observed changes in northern hemisphere mid and high latitudes and often from higher altitudes. significant evidence comes from high latitude waters in the northern hemisphere as well. evidence is primarily found in places where warming is most pronounced. documentation of observed changes in tropical regions is still sparse. the evidence for adaptation and vulnerability to observed climate change is most prevalent in places where warming has been the greatest and in systems that are more sensitive to temperature. thus documented changes relating to adaptation in the arctic and mountain regions include reduced outdoor and tourism activities and alterations in indigenous livelihoods in the arctic. responses to climate change including warming vary by community and are beginning to be systematically documented section. in terrestrial biological systems special conservation measures by resource managers are carried out as an adaptation to the impacts of climate change focusing on spatial strategies such as ecological networks short term refugia robust corridors transnational pathways or potential future protected areas opdam and wascher thomas gaston et al. documented evidence of adaptation to regional climate trends in the highly managed systems of agriculture and forestry is beginning to emerge such as shifts of sowing dates of annual crops in europe section. with regard to the assessment of vulnerability few studies have documented observed effects of warming in subsistence agricultural systems in rural populations in developing countries there are however well documented studies of adaptive responses and vulnerability to long term drought in the sahel. vulnerability appears to be high in the case of extreme events or exceptional episodes even in developed countries as documented by the agricultural response to and excess mortality occurring in the heatwaves in europe. the global decline in aggregate deaths and death rates due to extreme weather events during the th century suggest that adaptation measures to cope with some of the worst consequences of such events have been successful. however the european heatwave and the hurricane season in the north atlantic show that despite possessing considerable adaptive capacity even developed nations are vulnerable if they do not mobilise adaptation measures in timely and efficient manner. in human health air conditioning has contributed to declines in death rates during the summer in the usa and europe over the past years section. documentation of adaptation and vulnerability in terms of energy and tourism is limited section. there is notable lack of geographical balance in the data and literature on observed changes in natural and managed systems with marked scarcity from developing countries. regions with climate warming with an accumulation of evidence of observed changes in physical and or biological systems are europe northern asia north western north america and the antarctic peninsula. regions with warming where evidence of observed changes is sparse are africa and latin america and evidence is lacking in south east asia the indian ocean and regions in the pacific. possible reasons for this imbalance are lack of access by ipcc authors lack of data research and published studies lack of knowledge of system sensitivity differing system responses to climate variables lag effects in responses resilience in systems and the presence of adaptation. there is need to improve the observation networks and to enhance research capability on changes in physical biological and socio economic systems particularly in regions with sparse data. this will contribute to an improved functional understanding of the responses of natural and managed systems to

other communities relying on oral traditions. integrated assessments can involve one or more mathematical models but may also represent an integrated process of assessment linking different disciplines and groups of people. managing uncertainty in integrated assessments can utilise models ranging from simple models linking large scale processes through models of intermediate complexity to the complex physically explicit representation of earth systems. this structure is characterised by trade offs between realism and flexibility where simple models are more flexible but less detailed and complex models offer more detail and greater range of output. no single theory describes and explains dynamic behaviour across scales in socio economic and ecological systems rotmans and rothman nor can single model represent all the interactions within single entity or provide responses to questions in rapid turn around time schellnhuber et al. therefore integration at different scales and across scales is required in order to comprehensively assess cciav. some specific advances are outlined here integration to assess climate policy benefits is considered in section. cross sectoral integration is required for purposes such as national assessments analysis of economic and trade effects and joint population and climate studies. markets and trade can have significant effects on outcomes. for example study assessing the global impacts of climate change on forests and forest products showed that trade can affect efforts to stabilise atmospheric carbon dioxide co and also affected regional welfare with adverse effects on those regions with high production costs perez garcia et al. new economic assessments of aggregated climate change damages have also been produced for multiple sectors tol mendelsohn and williams nordhaus. these have highlighted potentially large regional disparities in vulnerability to impacts. using an integrated assessment general equilibrium model kemfert found that interactions between sectors acted to amplify the global costs of climate change compared with single sector analysis. integration yields results that cannot be produced in isolation. for example the millennium ecosystem assessment assessed the impact of broad range of stresses on ecosystem services of which climate change was only one millennium ecosystem assessment. linked impact and vulnerability assessments can also benefit from multiple stressors approach. for instance the air clim project integrated climate and air pollution impacts in europe between and concluding that that while the physical impacts were weakly coupled the costs of air pollution and climate change were strongly coupled. the indirect effects of climate policies stimulated cost reductions in air pollution control of more than alcamo et al. some of the joint effects of extreme weather and air pollution events on human health are described in chapter section. earth system models of intermediate complexity that link the atmosphere oceans cryosphere land system and biosphere are being developed to assess impacts particularly global scale singular events that may be considered dangerous within risk and vulnerability framework rial et al see also section. global climate models are also moving towards more complete representation of the earth system. recent simulations integrating the atmosphere with the biosphere via complete carbon cycle show the potential of the amazon rainforest to suffer dieback cox et al leading to positive feedback that decreases the carbon sink and increases atmospheric co concentrations friedlingstein et al denman et al. development of risk management frameworks risk management is defined as the culture processes and structures directed towards realising potential opportunities whilst managing adverse effects as nzs. risk is generally measured as combination of the probability of an event and its consequences iso iec see also figure with several ways of combining these two factors being possible. there may be more than one event consequences can range from positive to negative and risk can be measured qualitatively or quantitatively. to date most cciav studies have assessed climate change without specific regard to how mitigation policy will influence those impacts. however the certainty that some climate change will occur and is already occurring see chapter is driving adaptation assessment beyond the limits of what scenario driven methods can provide. the issues to be addressed include assessing current adaptations to climate variability and extremes before assessing adaptive responses to future climate assessing the limits of adaptation linking adaptation to sustainable development engaging stakeholders and decision making under uncertainty. risk management has been identified as framework that can deal with all of these issues in manner that incorporates existing methodologies and that can also accommodate other sources of risk jones willows and connell undp in process known as mainstreaming. the two major forms of climate risk management are the mitigation of climate change through the abatement of ghg emissions and ghg sequestration and adaptation to the consequences of changing climate figure. mitigation reduces the rate and magnitude of changing climate hazards adaptation reduces the consequences of those hazards jones. mitigation also reduces the upper bounds of the range of potential climate change while adaptation copes with the lower bounds yohe and toth. hence they are complementary chapter new assessment methods and the of future conditions processes but the benefits will accumulate over different time scales and in many cases they can be assessed and implemented separately klein et al. these and differences are discussed in section of this volume while integrated assessment methods utilising risk management approach are summarised by nakićenović et al. some of the standard elements within the risk management process that can be adapted to assess cciav are as follows. scoping exercise where the context of the assessment is established. this identifies the overall approach to be used. risk identification where what is at risk who is at risk the main climate and non climate stresses contributing to the risk and levels of acceptable risk are identified. this step also identifies the scenarios required for further assessment. risk analysis where the consequences and their likelihood are analysed. this is the most developed area with range of methods used in mainstream risk assessment and cciav assessment being available. risk treatment where selected adaptation and or mitigation measures are applied with follow up monitoring and review. these activities co ordinate the management of uncertainty and ensure that clarity and transparency surround the assumptions and concepts being used. other essential components of risk management include investment in obtaining improved information and building capacity for decision making adaptive governance see dietz et al. rather than being research driven risk management is oriented towards decision making on policy planning and management options. several frameworks have been developed for managing risk which use variety of approaches as outlined in table. the undpadaptation policy framework undp describes risk assessment methods that follow both the standard impact and human development approaches focusing on vulnerability and adaptation also see f\xfcssel and klein. national frameworks constructed to deliver national adaptation strategies include those of the uk willows and connell and australia australian greenhouse office. the world bank is pursuing methods for hazard and risk management that focus on financing adaptation to climate change vanaalst and mainstreaming climate change into natural hazard risk management burton and van aalst mathur et al bettencourt et al. therefore risk management is an approach that is being pursued for the management of climate change risks at range new assessment methods and the of future conditions

adaptation and mitigation depicted schematically. the right side shows likelihood based on threshold exceedance as function of global warming and the consequences of global warming reaching that particular level based on results from the tar. risk is function of probability and consequence. the primary time horizons of approaches to cciav assessment are also shown modified from jones. of scales from the global mitigation to achieve safe levels of ghg emissions and concentrations thus avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference to the local adaptation at the scale of impact to mainstreaming risk with multitude of other activities. managing uncertainties and confidence levels cciav assessments aim to understand and manage as much of the full range of uncertainty extending from emissions through to vulnerability ahmad et al as is practicable in order to improve the decision making process. at the same time primary aim of scientific investigations is to reduce uncertainty through improved knowledge. however such investigations do not necessarily reduce the uncertainty range as used by cciav assessments. phenomenon or process is usually described qualitatively before it can be quantified with any confidence some such as aspects of socio economic futures may never be well quantified morgan and henrion. often scientific advance will expand bounded range of uncertainty as new process is quantified and incorporated into the chain of consequences contributing to that range. examples include an expanded range of future global warming due to positive co feedbacks from the response of vegetation to climate change see section wg spm and widened range of future impacts that can be incurred by incorporating development futures in integrated impact assessments particularly if adaptation is included see section. in such cases although uncertainty appears to be expanding this is largely because the underlying process is becoming better understood. the variety of different approaches developed and applied since the tar all have their strengths and weaknesses. the impact assessment approach is particularly susceptible to ballooning uncertainties because of the limits of prediction jones. probabilistic methods and the use of thresholds are two ways in which these uncertainties are being managed jones and mearns see also section. another way to manage uncertainties is through participatory approaches resulting in learning by observation and learning by doing particular strength of vulnerability and adaptation approaches tompkins and adger undp. stakeholder participation establishes credibility and stakeholders are more likely to own the results increasing the likelihood of successful adaptation mckenzie hedger et al. development in methods thresholds and criteria for risk the risks of climate change for given exposure unit can be defined by criteria that link climate impacts to potential outcomes. this allows risk to be analysed and management options to be evaluated prioritised and implemented. threshold marks the point where stress on an exposed system or activity if exceeded results in non linear response in that system or activity. two types of thresholds are used in assessing change kenny et al jones see also chapter section. non linear change in state where system shifts from one identifiable set of conditions to another systemic threshold. level of change in condition measured on linear scale regarded as unacceptable and inviting some form of response impact threshold. systemic threshold can often be objectively measured for example range of estimates of global mean warming is reported in meehl et al. defining the point at which irreversible melting of the greenland ice sheet would commence. if policy aim were to avoid its loss selecting from the given range critical level of warming that is not to be exceeded would require value judgement. in the case of an impact threshold the response is the non linear aspect for example management threshold kenny et al. exceeding management threshold will result in change of legal regulatory economic or cultural behaviour. hence both cases introduce critical thresholds ipcc parry et al pittock and jones where criticality exceeds in risk assessment terms the level of tolerable risk. critical thresholds are used to define the coping range see section. thresholds derived with stakeholders avoid the pitfall of researchers ascribing their own values to an assessment kenny et al pittock and jones conde and lonsdale. stakeholders thus become responsible for the management of the uncertainties associated with that threshold through ownership of the assessment process and its outcomes jones. the probability of threshold exceedance is being used in risk analyses jones on local and global scales. for example probabilities of critical thresholds for coral bleaching and mortality for sites in the great barrier reef as function of global warming show that catastrophic bleaching will occur biennially with warming of about jones. further examples are given in section. at global scale the risk of exceeding critical thresholds has been estimated within bayesian framework by expressing global warming and sea level rise as cumulative distribution functions that are much more likely to be exceeded at lower levels than higher levels jones mastrandrea and schneider yohe. however although this may be achieved for key global vulnerabilities there is often no straightforward way to integrate local critical thresholds into mass damage function of many different metrics across wide range of potential impacts jacoby. stakeholder involvement stakeholder involvement is crucial to risk adaptation and vulnerability assessments because it is the stakeholders who will be most affected and thus may need to adapt burton et al renn undp. stakeholders are characterised as individuals or groups who have anything of value both monetary and non monetary that may be affected by climate change or by the actions taken to manage anticipated climate chapter new assessment methods and the of future

rowe and frewer conde and lonsdale. individual and institutional knowledge and expertise comprise the principal resources for adapting to the impacts of climate change. adaptive capacity is developed if people have time to strengthen networks knowledge and resources and the willingness to find solutions cohen cebon et al ivey et al. kasperson argues that the success of stakeholder involvement lies not only in informing interested and affected people but also in empowering them to act on the enlarged knowledge. through an ongoing process of negotiation and modification stakeholders can assess the viability of adaptive measures by integrating scientific information into their own social economic cultural and environmental context van asselt and rotmans see also chapter section. however stakeholder involvement may occur in context where political differences inequalities or conflicts may be raised researchers must accept that it is not their role to solve those conflicts unless they want to be part of them conde and lonsdale. approaches to stakeholder engagement vary from passive interactions where the stakeholders only provide information to level where the stakeholders themselves initiate and design the process figure. indigenous knowledge studies are valuable source of information for cciav assessments especially where formally collected and recorded data are sparse huntington and fox. stakeholders are also central in assessing future needs for developing policies and measures to adapt nadarajah and rankin. these needs have been recognised in regional and national approaches to assessing climate impacts and adaptation including the uk climate impacts programme ukcip west and gawith the us national assessment synthesis team parson et al the arctic climate impact assessment acia the finnish national climate change adaptation strategy marttila et al and the related finadapt research consortium kankaanp\xe4\xe4 et al and the mackenzie basin impact study cohen. defining coping ranges the coping range of climate hewitt and burton is described in the tar as the capacity of systems to accommodate variations in climatic conditions smith et al and thus serves as suitable template for understanding the relationship between changing climate hazards and society. the concept of the coping range has since been expanded to incorporate concepts of current and future adaptation planning and policy horizons and likelihood yohe and tol willows and connell undp. it can therefore serve as conceptual model morgan et al which can be used to integrate analytical techniques with broader understanding of climate society relationships jones and mearns. the coping range is used to link the understanding of current adaptation to climate with adaptation needs under climate change. it is useful mental model to use with stakeholders new assessment methods and the of future conditions chapter figure. who often have an intuitive understanding of which risks can be coped with and which cannot that can subsequently be developed into quantitative model jones and boer. it can be depicted as one or more climatic or climate related variables upon which socio economic responses are mapped figure. the core of the coping range contains beneficial outcomes. towards one or both edges of the coping range outcomes become negative but tolerable. beyond the coping range the damages or losses are no longer tolerable and denote vulnerable state the limits of tolerance describing critical threshold left side of figure. coping range is usually specific to an activity group and or sector although society wide coping ranges have been proposed yohe and tol. risk is assessed by calculating how often the coping range is exceeded under given conditions. climate change may increase the risk of threshold exceedance but adaptation can ameliorate the adverse effects by widening the coping range right side of figure. the probability of exceeding these thresholds was function of both natural climate variability and climate change. yohe and tol explored hypothetical upper and lower critical thresholds for the river nile using current and historical streamflow data. the upper threshold denoted serious flooding and the lower threshold the minimum flow required to supply water demand. historical frequency of exceedance served as baseline from which to measure changing risks using range of climate scenarios. communicating uncertainty and risk communicating risk and uncertainty is vital part of helping people respond to climate change. however people often rely on intuitive decision making processes or heuristics in solving complicated problems of judgement and decision making tversky and kahneman. in many cases these heuristics are surprisingly successful in leading to successful decisions under information and time constraints gigerenzer muramatsu and hanich. for example people consistently overestimate the likelihood of low probability events kahneman and tversky kammen et al resulting in choices that may increase their exposure to harm thaler and johnson. these deficiencies in human judgement in the face of uncertainty are discussed at length in the tar ahmad et al. participatory approaches establish dialogue between stakeholders and experts where the experts can explain the uncertainties and the ways they are likely to be misinterpreted the stakeholders can explain their decision making criteria and the two parties can work together to design risk management strategy fischoff jacobs nrc. because stakeholders are often the decision makers themselves kelly and adger the communication of impact adaptation and vulnerability assessment has become more important jacobs dempsey and fisher f\xfcssel and klein. adaptation decisions also depend on changes occurring outside the climate change arena turner et al. if the factors that give rise to the uncertainties are described willows and connell stakeholders may view that information as more credible because they can make their own judgements about its quality and accuracy funtowicz and ravetz. people will remember and use uncertainty assessments when they can mentally link the uncertainty and events in the world with which they are familiar assessments of climate change uncertainty are more memorable and hence more influential when they fit into people pre existing mental maps of experience of climate variability or when sufficient detail is provided to help people to form new mental models hansen. this can be aided by the development of visual tools that can communicate impacts adaptation and vulnerability to stakeholders while representing uncertainty in an appropriate manner discovery software aggarwal et al. chapter new assessment

appropriate institutions and infrastructure to conduct systematic data collection and poor co ordination within and or between different government departments and agencies unfccc. significant gaps exist in the geographical coverage and management of existing global and regional earth observing systems and in the efforts to retrieve the available historical data. these are especially acute in developing country regions such as africa where lack of funds for modern equipment and infrastructure inadequate training of staff high maintenance costs and issues related to political instability and conflict are major constraints iri. as result in some regions observation systems have been in decline gcos see also chapter section. major deficiencies in data provision for socio economic and human systems indicators have been reported as key barrier to better understanding of nature society dynamics in both developed and developing countries wilbanks et al but see nordhaus. recognising

for climate trenberth et al and sea level bindoff et al. efforts are also being made to record human environment interactions in moderated online databases. for instance the desinventar database records climatic disasters of the recent past in latin america documenting not only the adverse climatic events themselves but also the consequences of these events and the parties affected. information on local coping strategies applied by different communities and sectors is being recorded by the unfccc many assessments are now obtaining data through stakeholder elicitation and survey methods. for example in many traditional societies large number of social interactions may not be recorded by bureaucratic processes but knowledge of how societies adapt to climate change perceive risk and measure their vulnerability is held by community members cohen acia see also section. even in data rich situations it is likely that some additional data from stakeholders will be required. characterising the future why and how do we characterise future conditions evaluations of future climate change impacts adaptation and vulnerability require assumptions whether explicit or implicit about how future socio economic and biophysical conditions will develop. the literature on methods of characterising the future has grown in tandem with the literature on cciav but these methods have not been defined consistently across different research communities. box presents consistent typology of that expands on the definitions presented in the tar carter et al for the purpose of clarifying

radiative forcing or global average temperature change do not exceed prescribed limit. although wide variety of mitigation scenarios have been developed most focus on economic and technological aspects of emissions reductions see morita et al van vuuren et al nakićenović et al. simple climate models have been used to explore the implications for global mean temperature see box and nakićenović et al but few aogcm runs have been undertaken see meehl et al for recent examples with few direct applications in regional impact assessments parry et al. an alternative approach uses simple climate model projections of global warming under stabilisation to scale aogcm patterns of climate change assuming unmitigated emissions and then uses the resulting scenarios to assess regional impacts bakkenes et al. the scarcity of regional socio economic land use and other detail commensurate with mitigated future has also hindered impact assessment see discussion in arnell et al. alternative approaches include using sres scenarios as surrogates for some stabilisation scenarios swart et al see table for example to assess impacts on ecosystems leemans and eickhout and coastal

mastrandrea and schneider neill and oppenheimer wigley harvey or on meta analysis of the literature hitz and smith. limitation of these types of analyses is that they are not based on consistent assumptions about socio economic conditions adaptation and sectoral interactions and regional climate change. third approach constructs single set of scenario assumptions by drawing on information from variety of different sources. for example one set of analyses combines climate change projections from the hadcm model based on the and co stabilisation scenarios with socio economic information

water resources crop yield and food security and malaria parry et al arnell et al. scenario integration the widespread adoption of sres based scenarios in studies described in this report see boxes to acknowledges the desirability of seeking consistent scenario application across different studies and regions. for instance sres based downscaled socio economic projections were used in conjunction with sres derived climate scenarios in set of global impact studies arnell et al see section. at regional scale multiple scenarios for the main global change drivers socio economic factors atmospheric co concentration climate factors land use and technology were developed for europe based on interpretations of the global ipcc sres storylines schr\xf6ter et al see box. although the sres driving factors were used as an integrating framework consistency between scenario types could only be ensured by regional modelling as simple downscaling from the global scenarios ignored important regional dependencies between climate and air pollution and between air pressure and sea level see carter et al. integration across scales was emphasised in the scenarios developed for the millennium ecosystem assessment ma carried out between and to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for human well being millennium ecosystem assessment. an sas approach see section was followed in developing scenarios at scales ranging from regional through national basin and local lebel et al. many differed greatly from the set of global mascenarios that were also constructed alcamo et al. this is due in part to different stakeholders being involved in the development of scenarios at each scale but also reflects an absence of feedbacks from the sub global to global scales lebel et al. large scale singularities large scale singularities are extreme sometimes irreversible changes in the earth system such as abrupt cessation of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation moc or melting of ice sheets in greenland or west antarctica see meehl et al randall et al also chapter section. with few exceptions such events are not taken into account in socio economic assessments of climate change. shutdown of the moc is simulated in earth system models of intermediate complexity subject to large rapid forcing meehl et al also chapter section. artificial hosing experiments assuming the injection of large amounts of freshwater into the oceans at high latitudes also have been conducted using aogcms vellinga and wood wood et al to induce an moc shutdown. substantial reduction of greenhouse

offset by climate change which by itself would have decreased discharges by. however this attribution is highly uncertain among other reasons due to the high uncertainty of observed precipitation time series. different catchments respond differently to the same change in climate drivers depending largely on catchment and hydrogeological characteristics and the amount of lake or groundwater storage in the catchment. number of lakes worldwide have decreased in size during the last decades mainly due to human water use. for some declining precipitation was also significant cause in the case of lake chad where both decreased precipitation and increased human water use account for the observed decrease in lake area since the coe and foley. for the many lakes rivers and wetlands that have

transport rainfall amounts and intensities are the most important factors controlling climate change impacts on water erosion nearing et al and they affect many geomorphologic processes including slope stability channel change and sediment transport rumsby and macklin rosso et al. there is no evidence for climate related trend in erosion and sediment transport in the past as data are poor and climate is not the only driver of erosion and sediment transport. examples of vulnerable areas can be found in north eastern brazil where the sedimentation of reservoirs is significantly decreasing water storage and thus water supply de araujo et al increased erosion due to increased precipitation intensities would exacerbate this problem. human settlements on steep hill slopes in particular informal settlements in metropolitan areas of developing countries united nations are vulnerable to increased water erosion and landslides. water use availability and stress human water use is dominated by irrigation which accounts for almost of global water withdrawals and for more than of global consumptive water use the water volume that is not available for reuse downstream shiklomanov and rodda. in most countries of the world except in few industrialised nations water use has increased over the last decades due to demographic and economic growth changes in lifestyle and expanded water supply systems. there is no evidence for climate related trend in water use in the past. this is due to the fact that water use is mainly driven by non climatic factors and to the poor quality of water use data in general and time series in particular. water availability from surface sources or shallow groundwater wells depends on the seasonality and interannual variability of streamflow and safe water supply is determined by seasonal low flows. in snow dominated basins higher temperatures lead to reduced streamflow and thus decreased water supply in summer barnett et al for example in southamerican river basins along the andes where glaciers are shrinking coudrain et al. in semi arid areas climate change may extend the dry season of no or very low flows which particularly affects water users unable to rely on reservoirs or deep groundwater wells giertz et al currently human beings and natural ecosystems in many river basins suffer from lack of water. in global scale assessments basins with water stress are defined either as having per capita water availability below yr based on long term average runoff or as having ratio of withdrawals to long term average annual runoff above. in water scarce areas people and ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to decreasing and more variable precipitation due to climate change. for example in the huanghe river basin in china yang et al the combination of increasing irrigation water consumption facilitated by reservoirs and decreasing precipitation associated with global el ni\xf1o southern oscillation enso events over the past half century has resulted in water scarcity wang et al. the irrigation dominated murray darling basin in australia suffers from decreased water inflows to wetlands and high salinity due

improve water quality in the future. in the eu for example more efficient wastewater treatment as required by the urban wastewater directive and the european water framework directive should lead to reduction in point source nutrient inputs to rivers. this is because the production and consumption of chemicals are likely to increase in the future in both developed and developing countries daughton and several of these pollutants are not removed by current wastewater treatment technology. with heavier rainfall non point pollution could increase in all countries. global scale quantitative scenarios of pollutant emissions tend to focus on nitrogen and the range of plausible futures is large. the scenarios of the millennium ecosystem assessment expect global nitrogen fertiliser use to reach to mt by as compared to mt in millennium ecosystem assessment. in three of the four scenarios total nitrogen load increases at the global scale while in the fourth technogarden scenario similar to the sres scenario there is reduction of atmospheric nitrogen deposition as compared to today so that the total nitrogen load to the freshwater system would decrease. diffuse emissions of nutrients and pesticides from agriculture are likely to continue to be an important water quality issue in developed countries and are very likely to increase in developing countries thus critically affecting water quality. the most important drivers of water use are population and economic development and also changing societal views on the value of water. the latter refers to such issues as the prioritisation of domestic and industrial water supply over irrigation water supply and the extent to which water saving technologies and water pricing are adopted. in all four millennium ecosystems assessment scenarios per capita domestic water use in is rather similar in all world regions around yr the european average in millennium ecosystem assessment. this assumes very strong increase in usage in sub saharan africa by factor of five and smaller increases elsewhere except for developed countries oecd where per capita domestic water use is expected to decline further gleick. in addition to these scenarios many other plausible scenarios of future domestic and industrial water use exist which can differ strongly seckler et al alcamo et al v\xf6r\xf6smarty et al. the future extent of irrigated areas is the dominant driver of future irrigation water use together with cropping intensity and irrigation water use efficiency. according to the food and agriculture organization fao agriculture projections developing countries with of the global irrigated area are likely to expand their irrigated area until by yr while the cropping intensity of irrigated land will increase from to crops yr and irrigation water use efficiency will increase slightly bruinsma. these estimates do not take into account climate change. most of this expansion is projected to occur in already water stressed areas such as southern asia northern china the near east and north africa. much smaller expansion of irrigated areas however is assumed in all four scenarios of the

places where water and wastewater treatment plants already exist the greater presence of wider variety of micro organisms will pose threat because the facilities are not designed to deal with them. as

worsens. it is estimated that at least one tenth of the world population consumes crops irrigated with wastewater smit and nasr mostly in developing countries inafrica asia and latinamerica dfid. this number will increase with growing populations and wealth and it will become imperative to use water more efficiently including reuse. while recognising the convenience of recycling nutrients jim\xe9nez and gardu\xf1o it is essential to be aware of the health and environmental risks caused by reusing low quality water. in developing countries vulnerabilities are related to lack of relevant information institutional weakness in responding to changing environment and the need to mobilise resources. for the world as whole vulnerabilities are related to the need to respond proactively to environmental changes under uncertainty. effluent disposal strategies under conditions of lower self purification in warmer water the design of water and wastewater treatment plants to work

indirect consequences of geomorphic change for water quality dennis et al. all studies on soil erosion have suggested that increased rainfall amounts and intensities will lead to greater rates of erosion unless protection measures are taken. soil erosion rates are expected to change in response to changes in climate for variety of reasons. the most direct is the change in the erosive power of rainfall. other reasons include changes in plant canopy caused by shifts in plant biomass production associated with moisture regime changes in litter cover on the ground caused by changes in plant residue decomposition rates driven by temperature in moisture dependent soil microbial activity and in plant biomass production rates changes in soil moisture due to shifting precipitation

environment interacting as functional unit millennium ecosystem assessment reid et al. ecosystems may be usefully identified through having strong interactions between components within their boundaries and weak interactions across boundaries reid et al part. ecosystems are well recognised as critical in supporting human well being reid et al and the importance of their preservation under anthropogenic climate change is explicitly highlighted in article the objective of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc. in this chapter the focus is on the properties goods and services of non intensively managed and unmanaged ecosystems and their components as grouped by widely accepted functional and structural classifications figure and their potential vulnerability to climate change as based on scenarios mainly from ipcc see chapter and ipcc. certain ecosystem goods and services are treated in detail in other sectoral chapters this volume chapters water food fibre fisheries coasts and health. key findings from this chapter are further developed in the synthesis chapters to this volume. region specific aspects of ecosystems are discussed in chapters to this volume. this chapter is based on work published since the third assessment report of the ipcc tar gitay et al. processes at large spatial scales the biosphere at the global scale are generally characterised by slow response times on the order of centuries and even up to millennia jansen et al. however it is also important to note that some large scale responses in the palaeorecord jansen et al and to current climate anomalies such as el ni\xf1o events may emerge at much shorter time scales holmgren et al sarmiento and gruber stenseth et al van der werf et al. at continental scales biomes see glossary respond at decadal to millennial time scales davis prentice et al lischke et al neilson et al and groups of organisms forming ecological communities at the regional scale have shorter response times of years to centuries. responses of populations interbreeding individuals of the same species occur at intermediate temporal scales of months to centuries and underpin changes in biodiversity. these include changes at the genetic level that may be adaptive as demonstrated for example for trees jump et al and corals coles and brown. fast physiological response times seconds hours days months of micro organisms plants and animals operate at small scales from leaf or organ to the cellular level they underlie organism responses to environmental conditions and are assessed here if they scale up to have significant impact at broader spatial scales or where the mechanistic understanding assists in assessing key thresholds in higher level responses. the spatial distribution of ecosystems at biome scale has traditionally been explained only in terms of climate control schimper but it is increasingly apparent that disturbance regimes such as fire or insects

of warming and water limited biomes prone to increasing levels of drought. some such as fire dependent biomes may be in meta stable state that can change rapidly under climate and other environmental changes scheffer et al sankaran et al. biomes therefore provide useful level of ecological organisation at which to summarise climate change impacts being of large enough extent to conduct global synthesis yet having response time relevant to anthropogenic climate change. ecosystem goods and services ecosystems provide many goods and services that are of vital importance for the functioning of the biosphere and provide the basis for the delivery of tangible benefits to human society. supporting services such as primary and secondary production and biodiversity resource that is increasingly recognised to sustain many of the goods and services that humans enjoy from ecosystems. regulating services which are of paramount importance for human society such as carbon sequestration climate and water regulation protection from natural hazards such as floods avalanches or rock fall water and air purification and disease and pest regulation. key issues based on new findings for ecosystems since the tar we highlight here five overarching key issues pertinent to assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems to anthropogenic climate change and related adaptation responses. firstly ecosystems are expected to tolerate some level of future climate change and in some form or another will continue to persist kirschbaum and fischlin gitay et al as they have done repeatedly with palaeoclimatic changes jansen et al. primary key issue however is whether ecosystem resilience understood as the disturbance an ecosystem can tolerate before it shifts into different state scheffer et al cropp and gabrica folke et al inferred from these responses harrison and prentice will be sufficient to tolerate future anthropogenic climate change chapin et al jump and pe\xf1uelas. these may occur in certain terrestrial ecosystems through likely atmospheric co fertilisation effects and or modest warming baker et al lewis et al malhi and phillips and demonstrated consequences of increased radiation due to reduced tropical cloudiness nemani et al. secondly ecosystems are increasingly being subjected to other human induced pressures such as extractive use of goods and increasing fragmentation and degradation of natural habitats bush et al. however this is likely to be complex relationship that may also include some region specific reductions in land use pressures on ecosystems goklany rounsevell et al. projected future climate change and other human induced pressures are virtually certain to be unprecedented forster et al compared with the past several hundred millennia petit et al augustin et al siegenthaler et al. fourthly the understanding of time lags in ecosystem responses is still developing including for example broad scale biospheric responses or shifting species geographical ranges. many ecosystems may take several centuries vegetation or even possibly millennia where soil formation is involved before responses to changed climate are played out lischke et al. better understanding of transient responses and the functioning of ecosystems under continuously changing conditions is needed to narrow uncertainties about critical effects and to develop effective adaptation responses at the time scale of interest to human society. this is crucial especially because of very likely link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the maintenance of ecosystem services duraiappah et al hooper et al diaz et al worm et al and thus extinctions critical for ecosystem functioning be they global or local are virtually certain to reduce societal options for adaptation responses. current sensitivities climatic variability and extremes the biosphere has been exposed to large variability and extremes of co and climate throughout geological history

Past century data are based on observations andclimate model data were normalised to be in accord with theseobservations for the 1961-1990 data (CRU-PIK). Transient futureprojections are for the SRES A2 and B1 emissions scenarios(Naki\xb4cenovi\xb4c et al., 2000), forcing the climate models HadCM3 andECHAM5, respectively (cf.

Note that these projections assumean effective CO2-fertilisation (see Section 4.4.1).",context:"data for temperate zone ecosystems under future co scenarios suggest that this may be reduced by less than across all weather conditions. water savings through elevated co hold limited benefits for trees during drought because nutrient availability in drying top soil becomes interrupted and initial water savings are exhausted leuzinger et al. repeated drought with high temperatures europe in box may reduce landscape wide carbon stocks ciais et al. studies using land surface model indicate at least for the past century hydrological response up to the global scale of increasing runoff gedney et al that is consistent with expected stomatal responses to rising co hetherington and woodward gedney et al. soil nitrogen availability is key to predicting future carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems reich et al especially in light of global nitrogen deposition trends fold increase in some industrialised areas matson et al. the future ability of ecosystems overall to sequester additional carbon is very likely to be constrained by levels of nitrogen availability and fixation and other key nutrients such as phosphorus that may also become increasingly limiting hungate et al. carbon accumulation and sequestration in critical soil stocks see figure has been found to be strongly nitrogen constrained both because levels well above typical atmospheric inputs are needed to stimulate soil sequestration and because natural fixation appears to be particularly strongly limited by key nutrients van groenigen et al. results from loblolly pine forest lichter et al and grassland experiments van kessel et al suggest reduced likelihood for co fertilisation driven carbon accumulation in soils probably because carbon sequestration to humus is more nutrient demanding not only nitrogen than is wood formation for example hungate et al. carbon accretion in soil is therefore itself likely to exert negative feedback on plant growth by immobilising soil nutrients in addition to cation depletion by acidic precipitation contributing to faster diminishing of the biospheric sink see figure reich et al than implemented in model projections scholze et al see figure. accumulation of seasonally transitory soil carbon pools such as in fine roots has been found at elevated ambient co concentrations but the general validity of such enhanced fluxes and what fraction of these might be sequestered to recalcitrant see glossary soil carbon stocks remains unresolved norby et al. this results in the commonly observed short term less than decadal loss of carbon in warming experiments followed by the re establishment of new equilibrium between inputs and losses of soil carbon eliasson et al knorr et al. recent observations indeed show widespread carbon losses from soils bellamy et al schulze and freibauer that are consistent with this formulation. however in regions with thawing permafrost decay of historically accumulated soil carbon stocks yedoma years old figure due to warming zimov et al and nutrient deposition blodau mack et al could release large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere see also section. increased npp but see angert et al and vegetation change see section and sturm et al may partly counterbalance this carbon release see section and sitch et al thus complicating projections blodau for full discussion see section. ecosystem changes associated with land use and land cover change see section are complex involving number of feedbacks lepers et al reid et al. for example conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural land drives climate change by altering regional albedo and latent heat flux causing additional summer warming in key regions in the boreal and amazon regions and winter cooling in the asian boreal zone chapin et al feddema et al by releasing co via losses of biomass and soil carbon gitz and ciais canadell et al levy et al and through land use amplifier effect gitz and ciais. in contrast reforestation and other land use or land management changes such as modifications of agricultural practices can work to mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration lal jones and donnelly king et al wang et al de koning et al nabuurs et al. this mitigation potential is probably limited to reducing the ultimate atmospheric co increase by by between and ppm house et al and by approximately century long time lags until mature forests are established see sections and and is probably offset by regional warming effects of lower albedo with poleward boreal forest expansion betts for full discussion see section. the sequestration and cycling of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems is key vulnerability given the above drivers their generally global extent their potential irreversibility and the likely existence of threshold type impacts. the extent to which the recently discovered methane release from plant foliage keppler et al can be scaled to biome level is under debate houweling et al and highlights the currently limited understanding of the methane cycle and its exclusion from earth system models betts and shugart. nonetheless recent work especially with dgvm approaches has begun to elucidate the likelihood of occurrence of important thresholds and positive feedback to the atmosphere through diminishing co sequestration or even net carbon release from ecosystems thus amplifying climate change friedlingstein et al lucht et al scholze et al. global estimates is hacm sul cramer et al suggest reduced global sink relative to that expected under co fertilisation alone both in pgcy and pgcy as result of climate change impacts on net biome productivity nbp of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. according to these models the rate of nbp increase slows by around as co fertilisation itself saturates and in four of six models shows further climate induced nbp declines due to increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical npp after. these trends are projected to continue until mid century even with stabilised atmospheric co concentration and instantaneously stabilised climate beyond chapter ecosystems their properties goods and services woodward and lomas see also next paragraph figure. more recent modelling based on projected deforestation and climate change for the is emissions scenario and the cgcm csiro echam hadcm climate models in the tropics alone suggests an additional release of to pgc adding between and ppm to global atmospheric co by

underlying ecosystem changes. note that these projections assume an effective co fertilisation see section. but chiefly that human overuse and land degradation exacerbated by an overall lack of infrastructure and investment in resource management would be very likely to overwhelm climate change impacts with the exception of impacts of increased dry and wet extremes due to enso frequency increase and negative impacts of projected warming and drying in high biodiversity regions. on the other hand evidence for region specific increases in productivity and even community compositional change due to rising atmospheric co was reported with associated increased biomass and soil organic matter. overall impacts of elevated co were reported as comparable though usually opposite in sign to climate change projections. since the tar further work shows that desert biodiversity is likely to be vulnerable to climate change reid et al with winter rainfall desert vegetation and plant and animal species especially vulnerable to drier and warmer conditions lenihan et al simmons et al musil et al malcolm et al and continental deserts vulnerable to desiccation and even soil mobilisation especially with human land use pressures thomas and leason. however the potentially positive impact of rising atmospheric co remains significant uncertainty especially because it is likely to increase plant productivity particularly of plants thuiller et al and together with rainfall change could even induce wildfires bachelet et al hardy duraiappah et al. the uncertain impact of elevated co on vegetation productivity and biogeochemical cycling in deserts is an important source of contrasting projections of impacts and vulnerability for different desert regions and vegetation types. climate change and direct human land use pressure are likely to have synergistic impacts on desert ecosystems and species that may be offset at least partly by vegetation productivity and carbon sequestration gains due to rising atmospheric co. the net effect of these trends is very likely to be region specific. impacts deserts are likely to experience more episodic climate events and interannual variability may increase in future though there is substantial disagreement between gcm projections and across different regions smith et al duraiappah et al. vulnerability to desertification will be enhanced due to the indicated increase in the incidence of severe drought globally burke et al. in the americas temperate deserts are projected to expand substantially under doubled co climate scenarios lauenroth et al. however dry spell duration and warming trend effects on vegetation productivity may be at least partly offset by rising atmospheric co effects on plants bachelet et al thuiller et al leading to sometimes contrasting projections for deserts that are based on different modelling techniques that either incorporate or ignore co fertilisation effects. elevated co has

limitations section and references cited therein these models offer the advantage of assessing climate change impacts on biodiversity quantitatively thomas et al. climate envelope models do not simulate dynamic population or migration processes and results are typically constrained to the regional level so that the implications for biodiversity at the global level are difficult to infer malcolm et al. in modelling ecosystem function and plant functional type response understanding has deepened since the tar though consequential uncertainties remain. the processes affected by climate change and the mechanisms by which climate change may impact biomes ecosystem components such as soils fire behaviour and vegetation structure biomass distribution and leaf area index are now explicitly modelled and have been bolstered by experimental results woodward and lomas. one emerging key message is that climate change impacts on the fundamental regulating services may previously have been underestimated sections figures. nevertheless the globally applicable dgvms are limited inasmuch as the few plant functional types used within the models aggregate numerous species into single entities sitch et al. these are assumed to be entities with very broad environmental tolerances which are immutable and immune to extinction. therefore underlying changes in species richness are not accounted for and the simultaneous free dispersal of pfts is assumed neilson et al midgley et al. the strength of dgvms is especially in their global application realistic dynamics and simulation of ecosystem processes including essential elements of the global cycle malcolm et al. thus it is reasonable to equate changes in dgvm simulated vegetation figure to changes in community and population structures in the real world. what overall picture emerges from the results reviewed here it appears that moderate levels of atmospheric co rise and climate change relative to current conditions may be beneficial in some regions nemani et al depending on latitude on the co responsiveness of plant functional types and on the natural adaptive capacity of indigenous biota mainly

identify without substantial uncertainties they may lead to irreversible effects such as biodiversity loss or at the very least impacts that have slow recovery on soils and corals. in the two simulations presented in figure warming of and by over land relative to the baseline the dgvm approach reveals salient changes in key regulating service of the world ecosystems carbon sequestration. changes in the spatial distributions of ecosystems are given in figure where it must be stressed that the figure highlights only key vulnerabilities through depicting appreciable vegetation type changes pft change over of the area of any single pixel modelled. in the emissions scenario figure about of extant ecosystems reveal appreciable changes by with some positive impacts especially in africa and the southern hemisphere. however these positive changes are likely to be due to the assumed co fertilisation effect section figure. by contrast in mid to high latitudes on all continents substantial shifts in forest structure toward more rain green summer green or deciduous rather than evergreen forest and forest and woodland decline underlie the overall drop in global terrestrial carbon sequestration potential that occurs post and approaches net source by about figure. in the emissions scenario roughly of extant ecosystems reveal appreciable changes by. desert amelioration persists in the regions described above but substantial decline of forest and woodland is seen at northern tropical and sub tropical latitudes. in both scenarios the current global sink deteriorates after and by over pre industrial the terrestrial biosphere becomes an increasing carbon source figure see also scholze et al with the concomitant risk of positive feedback developments that amplify climate change. similar results were obtained by using wide range of climate models which indicate that the biosphere becomes consistently within this century net co source with global warming of relative to pre industrial scholze et al. on the other hand it must be noted that by about the modelled biosphere has nevertheless sequestered an additional pgc and emissions scenarios respectively relative to the year lucht et al. climate envelope modelling suggests that climate change impacts will diminish the areal extent of some ecosystems reduction by alone due to warming above pre industrial table no. climate impacts alone will vary regionally and across biomes and will lead to increasing levels of global biodiversity loss as expressed through area reductions of wild habitats and declines in the abundance of wild species putting those species at risk of extinction of european plants with warming table no. or major losses of amazon rainforest with warming above pre industrial figure table no. globally biodiversity represented by species richness and relative abundance may decrease by to due to combination of land use change climate change and nitrogen deposition under four scenarios by relative to species present in duraiappah et al. looking at projected losses due to land use change alone native habitat loss habitat reduction in tropical forests and woodland savanna and warm mixed forest accounts for of the species projected to be lost about species sala. the apparent contrast between high impacts shown by projections for species climate envelope models relative to pfts dgvms is likely to be due to number of reasons most importantly real species virtually certainly have narrower climate tolerances than pfts fact more realistically represented by the climate envelope models. dgvm projections reveal some increasing success of broad range generalist plant species while climate envelope model results focus on endemics. endemics with their smaller ranges have been shown to have greater vulnerability to climate change thuiller et al and may furthermore be dependent on keystone species in relationships that are ignored in dgvms. therefore for assessing extinction risks climate envelope modelling currently appears to offer more realistic results. as indicated in the tar climate changes are being imposed on ecosystems experiencing other substantial and largely detrimental pressures. this alone will be likely to cause widespread biodiversity loss chapin et al jenkins reid et al given that species from every major taxonomic group are already listed as threatened baillie et al. the likely synergistic impacts of climate change and land use change on endemic species have been widely confirmed hannah et al hughes leemans and eickhout thomas et al lovejoy and hannah hare malcolm et al warren as has over exploitation of marine systems worm et al chapters and. overall climate change has been estimated to be major driver of biodiversity loss in cool conifer forests savannas mediterranean climate systems tropical forests in the arctic tundra and in coral reefs thomas et al carpenter et al malcolm et al. in other ecosystems land use change may be stronger driver of biodiversity loss at least in the near term. in an analysis of the sres scenarios to strengers et al deforestation is reported to cease in all scenarios except suggesting that beyond climate change is very likely to be the major driver for biodiversity loss globally. due to climate change alone it has been estimated that by between and of endemic species average will be committed to extinction dgvm based study malcolm et al whereas following another approach also using climate envelope modelling based studies thomas et al it has been estimated that on average to of species combination of most optimistic assumptions most pessimistic will be committed to extinction by their range sizes will have begun shrinking and fragmenting in

remains. improved prediction of future impacts of climate change requires better representation of climate variability at scales from the short term including extreme events to interannual and decadal in ffff models. calls by the tar to enhance crop model inter comparison studies have remained largely unheeded. improvements and further evaluation of economic trade and technological components within integrated assessment models are needed including new global simulation studies that incorporate new crop forestry and livestock knowledge in models. few experimental or field studies have investigated the impacts of future climate scenarios on aquatic biota. future trends in aquatic primary production depend on nutrient supply and on temperature sensitivity of primary production. both of these could be improved with relatively small research effort. in spite of decade of prioritisation adaptation research has failed to provide generalised knowledge of the adaptive capacity of ffff systems across range of climate and socio economic futures and across developed and developing countries including commercial and small holder operations. more complete range of adaptation strategies must be examined in modelling frameworks in ffff. accompanying research that estimates the costs of adaptation is needed. assessments of how to move from potential adaptation options to adoption taking into account decision making complexity diversity at different scales and regions non linearities and time lags in responses and biophysical economic institutional and cultural barriers to change are needed. the global impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security will depend on the future role of agriculture in the global economy. while most studies available for the fourth assessment assume rapidly declining role of agriculture in the overall generation of income no consistent and comprehensive assessment was available. given the importance of this assumption more research is needed to assess the future role of agriculture in overall income formation and dependence of people on agriculture for income generation and food consumption in essentially all developing countries such an exercise could also afford an opportunity to review and critique the sres scenarios. relatively moderate impacts of climate change on overall agro ecological conditions are likely to mask much more severe climatic and economic vulnerability at the local level. more research is required to identify highly vulnerable micro environments and associated households and to provide agronomic and economic coping strategies for the affected populations. the impact of climate change on utilisation of biofuel crops is not well established. research on biomass feed stock

bleaching and mortality. coasts will be exposed to increasing risks including coastal erosion over coming decades due to climate change and sea level rise very high confidence. anticipated climate related changes include an accelerated rise in sea level of up to or more by further rise in sea surface temperatures by up to an intensification of tropical and extra tropical cyclones larger extreme waves and storm surges altered precipitation run off and ocean acidification. these phenomena will vary considerably at regional and local scales but the impacts are virtually certain to be overwhelmingly negative. increases in sea surface temperature of about to are projected to result in more frequent coral bleaching events and widespread mortality unless there is thermal adaptation or acclimatisation by corals box. degradation of coastal ecosystems especially wetlands and coral reefs has serious implications for the well being of societies dependent on the coastal ecosystems for goods and services. increased flooding and the degradation of freshwater fisheries and other resources could impact hundreds of millions of people and socio economic costs on coasts will escalate as result of climate change. the impact of climate change on coasts is exacerbated by increasing human induced pressures very high confidence. utilisation of the coast increased dramatically during the th century and this trend is virtually certain to continue through the st century. under the sres scenarios the coastal population could grow from billion people in to to billion people by the depending on assumptions about migration. increasing numbers of people and assets at risk at the coast are subject to additional stresses due to land use and hydrological changes in catchments including dams that reduce sediment supply to the coast. populated deltas especially asian megadeltas low lying coastal urban areas and atolls are key societal hotspots of coastal vulnerability occurring where the stresses on natural systems coincide with low human adaptive capacity and high exposure. climate change therefore reinforces the desirability of managing coasts in an integrated manner. adaptation for the coasts of developing countries will be more challenging than for coasts of developed countries due to constraints on adaptive capacity high confidence. while physical exposure can significantly influence vulnerability for both human populations and natural systems lack of adaptive capacity is often the most important factor that creates hotspot of human vulnerability. developing nations may have the political or societal will to protect or relocate people who live in low lying coastal zones but without the necessary financial and other resources capacities their vulnerability is much greater than that of developed nation in an identical coastal setting. vulnerability will also vary between developing countries while developed countries are not insulated from the adverse consequences of extreme events. adaptation costs for vulnerable coasts are much less than the costs of inaction high confidence. adaptation costs for climate change are much lower than damage costs without adaptation for most developed coasts even considering only property losses and human deaths. as post event impacts on coastal businesses people housing public and private social institutions natural resources and the environment generally go unrecognised in disaster cost accounting the full benefits of adaptation are even larger. without adaptation the high end sea level rise scenarios combined with other climate changes increased storm intensity are as likely as not to render some islands and low lying areas unviable by so effective adaptation is urgently required. the unavoidability of sea level rise even in the longer term frequently conflicts with present day human development patterns and trends high confidence. sea level rise has substantial inertia and will continue beyond for many centuries. irreversible breakdown of the west antarctica and or greenland ice sheets if triggered by rising temperatures would make this long term rise significantly larger ultimately questioning the viability of many coastal settlements across the globe. the issue is reinforced by the increasing human use of the coastal zone. settlement patterns also have substantial inertia and this issue presents challenge for long term coastal spatial planning. stabilisation of climate could reduce the risks of ice sheet breakdown and reduce but chapter coastal systems and low lying areas not stop sea level rise due to thermal expansion box. hence it is now more apparent than it was in the tar that the most appropriate response to sea level rise for coastal areas is combination of adaptation to deal with the inevitable rise and mitigation to limit the long term rise to manageable level. introduction scope summary of third assessment report conclusions and key issues this chapter presents global perspective on the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on coastal and adjoining low lying areas with an emphasis on post insights. here coastal systems are considered as the interacting low lying areas and shallow coastal waters including their human components figure. this includes adjoining coastal lowlands which have often developed through sedimentation during the holocene past years but excludes the continental shelf and ocean margins for marine ecosystems see chapter. in addition to local drivers and interactions coasts are subject to external events that pose hazard to human activities and may compromise the natural functioning of coastal systems figure. in this chapter we reinforce the findings of the third assessment report tar ipcc concerning the potential importance of the full range of climate change drivers on coastal systems and the complexity of their potential effects. the tar also noted growing interest in adaptation to climate change in coastal areas trend which continues to gather momentum as shown in this assessment. whereas some coastal countries and communities have the adaptive capacity to minimise the impacts of climate change others have fewer options and hence are much more vulnerable to climate change. this is compounded as human population growth in many coastal regions is both increasing socio economic vulnerability and decreasing the resilience of coastal systems. integrated assessment and management of coastal systems together with better understanding of their interaction with socio economic and cultural development were presented in the tar as important components of successful adaptation to climate change. this chapter builds on and develops these insights in the tar by considering the emerging knowledge concerning impacts and adaptation to climate change in coastal areas across wider spectrum of climate change drivers and from local to global scales. nonetheless the issue of sea level rise still dominates the literature on coastal areas and climate change. this chapter includes an assessment of current sensitivity and vulnerability the key changes that coastal systems may undergo in response to climate and sea level change including costs and other socio economic aspects the potential for adaptation and the implications for sustainable development. given that there are strong interactions both within and between the natural and human sub systems in the coastal system figure this chapter takes an integrated perspective of the coastal zone and its management insofar as the published literature permits. current sensitivity vulnerability this section provides key insights into the ways in which coastal systems are presently changing as context for assessing the impacts of and early effects attributable to climate change. natural coastal systems coasts are dynamic systems undergoing adjustments of form and process termed morphodynamics at different time and space scales in response to and oceanographical factors cowell et al. human activity exerts additional pressures that may dominate over natural processes. adapting to global climate change however requires insight into processes at decadal to century scales at which understanding is least developed de groot donnelly et al. coastal landforms affected by short term perturbations such as storms generally return to their pre disturbance morphology implying simple morphodynamic equilibrium. many coasts undergo continual adjustment towards dynamic equilibrium often adopting different states in response to varying wave energy and sediment supply woodroffe. coasts respond to altered conditions external to the system such as storm events or changes triggered by internal thresholds that cannot be predicted on the basis of external stimuli. this natural variability of coasts can make it difficult to identify the impacts of climate change. for example most beaches worldwide show evidence of recent erosion but sea level rise is not necessarily the primary driver. erosion can result from other factors such as altered wind patterns pirazzoli et al regnauld et al coastal systems and low lying areas chapter figure. climate change and the coastal system showing the major climate change factors including external marine and terrestrial influences. major challenge is determining whether observed changes have resulted from alteration in external factors such as climate change exceeding an internal threshold such as delta distributary switching to new location or short term disturbance within natural climate variability such as storm. climate related ocean atmosphere oscillations can lead to coastal changes viles and goudie. one of the most prominent is the el ni\xf1o southern oscillation enso phenomenon an interaction between pronounced temperature anomalies and sea level pressure gradients in the equatorial pacific ocean with an average periodicity of to years. recent research has shown that dominant wind patterns and storminess associated with enso may perturb coastal dynamics influencing beach morphodynamics in eastern australia ranasinghe et al short and trembanis mid pacific solomon and forbes and oregon allan et al cliff retreat in california storlazzi and griggs and groundwater levels in mangrove ecosystems in micronesia drexler and australia rogers et al. coral bleaching and mortality appear related to the frequency and intensity of enso events in the indo pacific region which may alter as component of climate change box becoming more widespread because of global warming stone et al. it is likely that coasts also respond to longer term variations for instance relationship with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo is indicated by monitoring of south east australian beach for more than years mclean and shen. correlations between the north atlantic oscillation nao and storm frequency imply similar periodic influences on atlantic coasts tsimplis et al and the indian ocean dipole iod may drive similar periodic fluctuations on coasts around the indian ocean saji et al. increasing human utilisation of the coastal zone few of the world coastlines are now beyond the influence of human pressures although not all coasts are inhabited buddemeier et al. utilisation of the coast increased dramatically during the th century trend that seems certain to continue through the st century section. coastal population growth in many of the world deltas barrier islands and estuaries has led to widespread conversion of natural coastal landscapes to agriculture aquaculture silviculture as well as industrial and residential uses valiela. it has been estimated that of the world population lives both within km distance of the coast and above sea level and population densities in coastal regions are about three times higher than the global average small and nicholls see also box. the attractiveness of the coast has resulted in rapid expansion of economic activity settlements urban centres and tourist resorts. migration of people to coastal regions is common in both developed and developing nations. rapid urbanisation has many consequences for example enlargement of natural coastal inlets and dredging of waterways for navigation port facilities and pipelines exacerbate saltwater intrusion into surface and ground waters. increasing shoreline retreat and risk of flooding of coastal cities in thailand durongdej saito india mohanti vietnam thanh et al and the united states scavia et al have been attributed to degradation of coastal ecosystems by human activities illustrating widespread trend. the direct impacts of human activities on the coastal zone have been more significant over the past century than impacts that can be directly attributed to observed climate change scavia et al lotze et al. engineering structures such as damming channelisation and diversions of coastal waterways harden the coast change circulation patterns and alter freshwater sediment and nutrient delivery. natural systems are often directly or indirectly altered even by soft engineering solutions such as beach nourishment and foredune construction nordstrom hamm and stive. ecosystem services on the coast are often disrupted by human activities. for example tropical and subtropical mangrove forests and temperate saltmarshes provide goods and services they accumulate and transform nutrients attenuate waves and storms bind sediments and support rich ecological communities which are reduced by large scale ecosystem conversion for agriculture industrial and urban development and aquaculture section. external terrestrial and marine influences external terrestrial influences have led to substantial environmental stresses on coastal and nearshore marine habitats sahagian saito nrc crossland et al. as consequence of activities outside the coastal zone natural ecosystems particularly within the catchments draining to the coast have been fragmented and the downstream flow of water sediment and nutrients has been disrupted nilsson et al section. land use change particularly deforestation and hydrological modifications have had downstream impacts in addition to localised development on the coast. erosion in the catchment has increased river sediment load for example suspended loads in the huanghe yellow river have increased to times over the past years jiongxin. in contrast damming and channelisation have greatly reduced the supply of sediments to the coast on other rivers through retention of sediment in dams syvitski et al. coasts can be affected by external marine influences figure. waves generated by storms over the oceans reach the coast as swell there

amplified in many areas by increased precipitation and higher groundwater levels examples include uk argentina and france hosking and mcinnes codignotto pierre and lahousse. hence four physical features of climate change temperature precipitation sea level and wave climate can affect the stability of soft rock cliffs. soft rock cliff retreat is usually episodic with many metres of cliff top retreat occurring locally in single event followed by relative quiescence for significant periods brunsden eurosion. considerable progress has been made in the long term prediction of cliff top shore profile and plan shape evolution of soft rock coastlines by simulating the relevant physical processes and their interactions hall et al trenhaile. an application of the scape soft cliff and platform erosion model dickson et al walkden and hall to part of norfolk uk has indicated that rates of cliff retreat are sensitive to sea level rise changes in wave conditions and sediment supply via longshore transport. for soft cliff areas with limited beach development there appears to be simple relationship between long term cliff retreat and the rate of sea level rise walkden and dickson allowing useful predictions for planning purposes. delta plains contain diverse range of landforms but at any time only part of delta is active and this is usually river dominated whereas the abandoned delta plain receives little river flow and is progressively dominated by marine processes woodroffe. human development patterns also influence the differential vulnerability of deltas to the effects of climate change. sediment starvation due to dams alterations in tidal flow patterns navigation and flood control works are common consequences of human activity table. changes in surface water runoff and sediment loads can greatly affect the ability of delta to cope with the physical impacts of climatic change. for example in the subsiding mississippi river deltaic plain of south east louisiana sediment starvation and increases in the salinity and water levels of coastal marshes due to human development occurred so rapidly that km of intertidal coastal marshes and adjacent lands were converted to open water between and barras et al. by about km of additional coastal land loss is projected if current global regional and local processes continue the projected acceleration of sea level and increase in tropical storm intensity section would exacerbate these losses barras et al. much of this land loss is episodic as demonstrated during the landfall of hurricane katrina box. deltas have long been recognised as highly sensitive to sea level rise ericson et al woodroffe et al box. rates of relative sea level rise can greatly exceed the global average in many heavily populated deltaic areas due to subsidence including the chao phraya delta saito mississippi river delta burkett et al and the changjiang river delta liu waltham because of human activities. natural subsidence due to autocompaction of sediment under its own weight is enhanced by sub surface fluid withdrawals and drainage table. this increases the potential for inundation especially for the most populated cities on these deltaic plains bangkok new orleans and shanghai. most of the land area of bangladesh consists of the deltaic plains of the ganges brahmaputra and meghna rivers accelerated global sea level rise and higher extreme water levels box may have acute effects on human populations of bangladesh and parts of west bengal india because of the complex relationships between observed trends in sst over the bay of bengal and monsoon rains singh subsidence and human activity that has converted natural coastal defences mangroves to aquaculture woodroffe et al. whereas present rates of sea level rise are contributing to the gradual diminution of many of the world deltas most recent losses of deltaic wetlands are attributed to human development. every delta showed land loss but at varying rates and human development activities accounted for over half of the losses. in asia for example where human activities have led to increased sediment loads of major rivers in the past the construction of upstream dams is now seriously depleting the supply of sediments to many deltas with increased coastal erosion widespread consequence see chapter section. as an example large reservoirs constructed on the huanghe river in china have reduced the annual sediment delivered to its delta from billion metric tons to billion metric tons li et al. human influence is likely to continue to increase throughoutasia and globally section table. sea level rise poses particular threat to deltaic environments especially with the synergistic effects of other climate and human pressures s\xe1nchez arcilla et al. these issues are especially noteworthy in many of the largest deltas with an indicative area km henceforth megadeltas due to their often large populations and important environmental services. the problems of climate change in megadeltas are reflected throughout this report with number of chapters considering these issues from complementary perspectives. box considers the vulnerability of delta systems across the globe and concludes that the large populatedasian megadeltas are especially vulnerable to climate change. chapter section builds on this global coastal systems and low lying areas chapter avulse when river changes its course from one channel to another as result of flood. deltas and megadeltas hotspots for vulnerability deltas some of the largest sedimentary deposits in the world are widely recognised as highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change particularly sea level rise and changes in runoff as well as being subject to stresses imposed by human modification of catchment and delta plain land use. most deltas are already undergoing natural subsidence that results in accelerated rates of relative sea level rise above the global average. many are impacted by the effects of water extraction and diversion as well as declining sediment input as consequence of entrapment in dams. delta plains particularly those in asia chapter section are densely populated and large numbers of people are often impacted as result of external terrestrial influences river floods sediment starvation and or external marine influences storm surges erosion see figure. estimated that nearly million people inhabit sample of deltas globally including all the large megadeltas. average population density is people km with the largest population in the ganges brahmaputra delta and the highest density in the nile delta. many of these deltas and megadeltas are associated with significant and expanding urban areas. used generalised modelling approach to approximate the effective rate of sea level rise under present conditions basing estimates of sediment trapping and flow diversion on global dam database and modifying estimates of natural subsidence to incorporate accelerated human induced subsidence. this analysis showed that much of the population of these deltas is at risk through coastal erosion and land loss primarily as result of decreased sediment delivery by the rivers but also through accentuated rates of sea level rise. they estimate using coarse digital terrain model and global population distribution data that more than million people will be directly affected by in three megadeltas the ganges brahmaputra delta in bangladesh the mekong delta in vietnam and the nile delta in egypt. more than people are likely to be directly impacted in each of further deltas and more than in each of further deltas figure. this generalised modelling approach indicates that of the population affected live on asian megadeltas and deltas and large proportion of the remainder are on deltas in africa. these impacts would be exacerbated by accelerated sea level rise and enhanced human pressures chapter section. within the asian megadeltas the surface topography is complex as result of the development of the deltas and the population distribution shows considerable spatial variability reflecting the intensive land use and the growth of some of the world largest megacities woodroffe et al. many people in these and other deltas worldwide are already subject to flooding from both storm surges and seasonal river floods and therefore it is necessary to develop further methods to assess individual delta vulnerability s\xe1nchez arcilla et al. relative vulnerability of coastal deltas as shown by the indicative population potentially displaced by current sea level trends to extreme million high million to medium to following ericson et al. view and examines the asian megadeltas in more detail. chapter box considers the threats to fisheries in the lower mekong and associated delta due to climate change. hurricane katrina made landfall on the mississippi delta in louisiana and box and chapter box consider different aspects of this important event which gives an indication of the likely impacts if tropical storm intensity continues to increase. estuaries and lagoons global mean sea level rise will generally lead to higher relative coastal water levels and increasing salinity in estuarine systems thereby tending to displace existing coastal plant and animal communities inland. estuarine plant and animal communities may persist as sea level rises if migration is not blocked and if the rate of change does not exceed the capacity of natural communities to adapt or migrate. climate change impacts on one or more leverage species however can result in sweeping community level changes harley et al. some of the greatest potential impacts of climate change on estuaries may result from changes in physical mixing characteristics caused by changes in freshwater runoff scavia et al. increased freshwater inflows decrease water residence time and increase vertical stratification and vice versa moore et al. the effects of altered residence times can have significant effects on phytoplankton populations which have the potential to increase fourfold per day. consequently in estuaries with very short water residence times phytoplankton are generally flushed from the system as fast as they can grow reducing the estuary susceptibility to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms habs section. changes in the timing of freshwater delivery to estuaries could lead to decoupling of the juvenile phases of many estuarine and marine fishery species from the available nursery habitat. in some hypersaline lagoonal systems such as the laguna madre of mexico and texas sea level rise will increase water depths leading to increased tidal exchange and hence reduced salinity cf. increased water temperature could also affect algal production and the availability of light oxygen and carbon for other estuarine species short and neckles. the propensity for habs is further enhanced by the fertilisation effect of increasing dissolved co levels. while temperature is important in regulating physiological processes in estuaries lomas et al predicting the ecological outcome is complicated by the feedbacks and interactions among temperature change and independent physical and biogeochemical processes such as eutrophication cf. decreased seawater ph and carbonate saturation mackenzie et al caldeira and wickett has at least two important consequences the potential for reducing the ability of carbonate flora and fauna to calcify and the potential for enhanced dissolution of nutrients and carbonate minerals in sediments andersson et al royal society turley et al. as these potential impacts could be significant it is important to improve understanding of them. the landward transgression of natural estuarine shorelines as sea level rises has been summarised by pethick who adopted mass balance approach based on an equilibrium assumption resulting in landward retreat of the entire estuarine system. in this view sea level rise of mm causes of retreat of the blackwater estuary uk and only of retreat for the humber estuary uk due to the steeper gradient of the latter. the humber estuary will also likely experience deepening of the main channel changes in tidal regime and larger waves that will promote further erosion around the margins winn et al. in situations where the area of intertidal environments has been reduced by embanking or reclamation the initial response will be lowering of remaining tidal flats and infilling of tidal channels. depending on tidal characteristics the availability of marine sediment and the rate of sea level rise the remaining tidal flats may either be further drowned or their relative level in the tidal frame may be maintained as shown by several tidal basins in the dutch wadden sea dronkers. mangroves saltmarshes and sea grasses coastal vegetated wetlands are sensitive to climate change

expected in the north while the largest reductions are expected in the mediterranean the south west balkans and southern russia maracchi et al. temperature increases can shorten growing cycles those of cotton and mango on the north coast of peru during the el ni\xf1o see chapter section. more frequent extreme climate events during specific crop development stages together with higher rainfall intensity and longer dry spells may impact negatively on crop yields olesen et al. cyclone landfalls causing floods and destruction have negative impacts on coastal areas on coconuts in india see chapter section or on sugar cane and bananas in queensland cyclone larry in march. rising sea level has negative impacts on coastal agriculture. detailed modelling of inundation implies significant changes to the number of rice crops possible in the mekong delta under cm of relative sea level rise wassmann et al. coastal forestry is little studied but forests are easily affected by climatic perturbations and severe storms can cause extensive losses hurricane katrina. radiata on the east coast of north island new zealand are likely to experience growth reductions under projected rainfall decreases ministry for the environment. increasing salinity and greater frequency of flooding due to sea level rise reduces the ability of trees to generate including mangroves which will also experience other changes section iucn. future climate change impacts will be greater on coastal than on pelagic species and for temperate endemics than for tropical species see chapter section. the biotic communities and productivity of coastal lagoons may experience variety of changes depending on the changes in wetland area freshwater flows and salt intrusion which affect the species. intensification of enso events and increases in sst wind stress hypoxia shortage of oxygen and the deepening of the thermocline will reduce spawning areas and catches of anchovy off peru see chapter table. there is also concern that climate change may affect the abundance and distribution of pathogens and habs with implications for aquatic organisms and human health section. the linkage between temperature changes and habs is still not robust and the extent to which coastal eutrophication will be affected by future climate variability will vary with local physical environmental conditions and current eutrophication status justic et al. climate change also has implications for mariculture but again these are not well understood. human settlements infrastructure and migration climate change and sea level rise affect coastal settlements and infrastructure in several ways table. sea level rise raises extreme water levels with possible increases in storm intensity portending additional climate impacts on many coastal areas box while saltwater intrusion may threaten water supplies. the degradation of natural coastal systems due to climate change such as wetlands beaches and barrier islands section removes the natural defences of coastal communities against extreme water levels during storms box. rapid population growth urban sprawl growing demand for waterfront properties and coastal resort development have additional deleterious effects on protective coastal ecosystems. much of the coast of many european and east asian countries have defences against flooding and erosion the netherlands jonkman et al and japan chapter section reflecting strong tradition of coastal defence. these urban systems are vulnerable to low probability extreme events above defence standards and to systemic failures domino effects the ports roads and railways along the us gulf and atlantic coasts are especially vulnerable to coastal flooding see chapter section. where these cities are subsiding there are additional risks of extreme water levels overtopping flood defences new orleans during hurricane katrina box. climate change and sea level rise will exacerbate flood risk. hence many coastal cities require upgraded design criteria for flood embankments and barrages the thames barrier in london the delta works in the netherlands shanghai defences and planned protection for venice fletcher and spencer see box and section. there is now better understanding of flooding as natural hazard and how climate change and other factors are likely to influence coastal flooding in the future hunt. however the prediction of precise locations for increased flood risk resulting from climate change is difficult as flood risk dynamics have multiple social technical and environmental drivers few et al. the population exposed to flooding by storm surges will increase over the st century table. asia dominates the global exposure with its large coastal population bangladesh china japan vietnam and thailand having serious coastal flooding problems see section chapter section mimura. africa is also likely to see substantially increased exposure with east africa mozambique having particular problems due to the combination of tropical storm landfalls and large projected population growth in addition to sea level rise nicholls. chapter coastal systems and low lying areas table shows estimates of coastal flooding due to storm surge taking into account one adaptation assumption. asia and africa experience the largest impacts without sea level rise coastal flooding is projected to diminish as problem under the sres scenarios while with sea level rise the coastal flood problem is growing by the most especially under the scenario. increased storm intensity would exacerbate these impacts as would larger rises in sea level including due to human induced subsidence nicholls. figure shows the numbers of people flooded in the as function of sea level rise and variable assumptions on adaptation. flood impacts vary with sea level rise scenario socio economic situation and adaptation assumptions. assuming that there will be no defence upgrade has dramatic impact on the result with more than million people flooded per year above cm rise for all sres scenarios. human health coastal communities particularly in low income countries are vulnerable to range of health effects due to climate variability and long term climate change particularly extreme weather and climate events such as cyclones floods and droughts as summarised in table. the potential impacts of climate change on populations in coastal regions will be determined by the future health status of the population its capacity to cope with climate hazards and control infectious diseases and other public health measures. coastal communities that rely on marine resources for food in terms of both supply and maintaining food quality food safety are vulnerable to climate related impacts in both health and economic terms. marine ecological processes linked to temperature changes also play role in determining human health risks such as from cholera and other

changes associated with enso are known to increase the risk of malaria epidemics in coastal regions of venezuela and colombia kovats et al. the projection of health impacts of climate change is still difficult and uncertain ebi and gamble kovats et al and socio economic factors may be more critical than climate. there are also complex relationships between ecosystems and human well being and the future coastal ecosystem changes discussed in section may affect human health cf. biodiversity the distribution production and many other aspects of species and biodiversity in coastal ecosystems are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate section affecting the distribution and abundance of the plant and animal species that depend on each coastal system type. human development patterns also have an important influence on biodiversity among coastal system types. mangroves for example support rich ecological communities of fish and crustaceans are source of energy for coastal food chains and export carbon in the form of plant and animal detritus stimulating estuarine and nearshore productivity jennerjahn and ittekkot. large scale conversions of coastal mangrove forests to shrimp aquaculture have occurred during the past three decades along the coastlines of vietnam binh et al bangladesh and india zweig hong kong tam and wong the philippines spalding et al mexico contreras espinosa and warner thailand furakawa and baba and malaysia ong. the additional stressors associated with climate change could lead to further declines in mangroves forests and their biodiversity. several recent studies have revealed that climate change is already impacting biodiversity in some coastal systems. long term monitoring of the occurrence and distribution of series of intertidal and shallow water organisms in south west britain has shown several patterns of change particularly in the case of barnacles which correlate broadly with changes in temperature over the several decades of record hawkins et al mieszkowska et al. it is clear that responses of intertidal and shallow marine organisms to climate change are more complex than simply latitudinal shifts related to temperature increase with complex biotic interactions superimposed on the abiotic harley et al helmuth et al. patterns of overwintering of migratory birds on the british coast appear to have changed in response to temperature rise rehfisch et al and it has been suggested that changes in invertebrate distribution might subsequently influence the distribution of ducks and wading birds kendall et al. however as detailed studies of redshank have shown the factors controlling distribution are complex and in many cases are influenced by human activities norris et al. piersma and lindstrom review changes in bird distribution but conclude that none can be convincingly attributed to climate change. loss of birds from some estuaries appears to be the result of coastal squeeze and relative sea level rise hughes knogge et al areport by the united nations framework convention on biodiversity cbd presents guidance for incorporating biodiversity considerations in climate change adaptation strategies with examples from several coastal regions. recreation and tourism climate change has major potential impacts on coastal tourism which is strongly dependent on sun sea and sand.

group healy. major storm and flood disasters have occurred in the last two decades. improved structural and non structural measures particularly improved warnings have decreased mortality from floods and storm surges in the last years eea however the impact of weather disasters in terms of social and health effects is still considerable and is unequally distributed see box. in terms of deaths and populations affected floods and tropical cyclones have the greatest impact in south asia and latin america guha sapir et al schultz et al. deaths from unsafe or unhealthy conditions following the extreme event are also health consequence but such information is rarely included in disaster statistics combs et al jonkman and kelman. drowning by storm surge is the major killer in coastal storms where there are large numbers of deaths. an assessment of surges in the past years found that major events were confined to limited number of regions with many events occurring in the bay of bengal particularly bangladesh nicholls. natural disasters have been shown to result in increased domestic violence against and post traumatic stress disorders in women anderson and manuel garrison et al

better quantitative estimates of saharan dust loadings and controls on emissions have now emerged from both satellite and field campaigns washington and todd washington et al. finally changes in extreme events such as droughts and floods have major implications for numerous africans and require further attention. droughts notwithstanding current limitations in modelling capabilities and understanding of atmospheric system complexity have attracted much interest over the past years amcen unep particularly with reference to impacts on both ecological systems and on society. droughts have long contributed to human migration cultural separation population dislocation and the collapse of prehistoric and early historic societies pandey et al. one third of the people in africa live in drought prone areas and are vulnerable to the impacts of droughts world water forum. in africa for example several million people regularly suffer impacts from droughts and floods. these impacts are often further exacerbated by health problems particularly diarrhoea cholera and malaria few et al. droughts have mainly affected the sahel the horn of africa and southern africa particularly since the end of the see section richard et al h\xf4te et al brooks christensen et al trenberth et al. floods are also critical and impact on african development. recurrent floods in some countries are linked in some cases with enso events. when such events occur important economic and human losses result in mozambique see mirza obasi. even countries located in dry areas algeria tunisia egypt somalia have not been flood free kabat et al. sensitivity vulnerability of the water sector the water sector is strongly influenced by and sensitive to changes in climate including periods of prolonged climate variability. evidence of interannual lake level fluctuations and lake level volatility for example has been observed since the probably owing to periods of intense droughts followed by increases in rainfall and extreme rainfall events in late in lakes tanganyika victoria and turkana see riebeek. the heavy rains and floods have been possibly attributed to large scale atmosphere ocean interactions

ethiopia legesse et al kenya and tanzania eriksen et al and the wider continent de wit and stankiewicz nkomo et al. fewer assessments of impacts and vulnerabilities with regard to groundwater and climate interactions are available and yet these are clearly of great concern for those dependent on groundwater for their water supply. about of the contemporary african population experiences high water stress about of the population lives under conditions of relative water abundance v\xf6r\xf6smarty et al. however this relative abundance does not take into account other equally important factors such as access to clean drinking water and sanitation which effectively reduces the quantity of freshwater available for human use. despite the considerable improvements in access to freshwater in the only about of theafrican population had access to improved water supplies in who unicef v\xf6r\xf6smarty. as illustrated in section issues that affect access to water including water governance also need to be considered in any discussion of vulnerability to water stress in africa. sensitivity vulnerability of the health sector assessments of health in africa show that many communities are already impacted by health stresses that are coupled to several causes including poor nutrition. these assessments repeatedly pinpoint the implications of the poor health status of many africans for future development figure sachs and malaney sachs. an estimated to million people die of malaria each year and of those are african children see http www cdc gov malaria patz and

an average annual reduction in economic growth of for those african countries with the highest burden gallup and sachs. the resurgence of malaria and links to climate and or other causal drivers of change in the highlands of east africa has recently attracted much attention and debate hay et al pascual et al. there are indications for example that in areas that have two rainy seasons march to june mamj and september to november son more rain is falling in son than previously experienced in the northern sector of east africa schreck and semazzi. the son period is relatively warm and higher

insights into the observed warming trends from the end of the onwards in four high altitude sites in east africa. new evidence regarding micro climate change due to land use changes such as swamp reclamation for agricultural use and deforestation in the highlands of western kenya suggests that suitable conditions for the survival of anopheles gambiae larvae are being created and therefore the risk of malaria is increasing munga et al. the average ambient temperature in the deforested areas of kakamega in the western kenyan highlands for example was higher than that of the forested area over month period afrane et al. mosquito pupation rates and larval to pupal development have been observed to be significantly faster in farmland habitats than in swamp and forest habitats munga et al. floods can also trigger malaria epidemics in arid and semi arid areas thomson et al. other diseases are also important to consider with respect to climate variability and change as links between variations in climate and other diseases such as cholera and meningitis have also been observed. about million people in africa live in areas with risk of meningitis molesworth et al figure. while factors that predispose populations to meningococcal meningitis are still poorly understood dryness very low humidity and dusty conditions are factors that need to be taken into account. recent study for example has demonstrated that wind speeds in the first two weeks of february explained of the variation in the number of meningitis cases sultan et al. sensitivity vulnerability of the agricultural sector the agricultural sector is critical mainstay of local livelihoods and national gdp in some countries in africa mendelsohn et al devereux and maxwell. the contribution of agriculture to gdp varies across countries but assessments suggest an average contribution of ranging from to of gdp mendelsohn et al. this sector is particularly sensitive to climate including periods of climate variability enso and extended dry spells see usman and reason. in many parts of africa farmers and pastoralists also have to contend with other extreme natural resource challenges and constraints such as poor soil fertility pests crop diseases and lack of access to inputs and improved seeds. these challenges are usually aggravated by periods of prolonged droughts and or floods and are often particularly severe during el ni\xf1o events mendelsohn et al biggs et al international institute of rural reconstruction vogel stige et al. sensitivity vulnerability of ecosystems ecosystems are critical in africa contributing significantly to biodiversity and human well being biggs et al muriuki et al. the rich biodiversity in africa which occurs principally outside formally conserved areas is under threat from climate variability and change and other stresses see chapter section. africa social and economic development is constrained by climate change habitat loss over

anthropogenic threats including sedimentation pollution and over fishing particularly when they are close to important human settlements such as towns and tourist resorts nelleman and corcoran. recent outbreaks of the crown of thorns starfish have occurred in egypt djibouti and western somalia along with some local bleaching kotb et al. observed changes in ecosystems are not solely attributable to

possibly be greater than those associated with human activity biggs et al anderssen et al. assessments of impacts on water resources as already indicated currently do not fully capture multiple future water uses and water stress and must be approached with caution see agoumi conway. conway argues that there is no clear indication of how nile flow will be affected by climate change because of the uncertainty about rainfall patterns in the basin and the influence of complex water management and water governance structures. clearly more detailed research on water hydrology drainage and climate change is required. future access to water in rural areas drawn from low order surface water streams also needs to be addressed by countries sharing river basins see de wit and stankiewicz. climate change should therefore be considered among range of other water governance issues in any future negotiations to share nile water conway stern. energy there are remarkably few studies available that examine the impacts of climate change on energy use in africa but see recent regional assessment by warren et al. however even in the absence of climate change number of changes are expected in the energy sector. africa recent and rapid urban growth unep will lead to increases in aggregate commercial energy demand and emissions levels davidson et al as well as extensive land use and land cover changes especially from largely uncontrolled urban peri urban and rural settlements unep grid arendal du plessis et al. these changes will alter existing surface microclimates and hydrology and will possibly exacerbate the scope and scale of climate change impacts. health vigorous debate among those working in the health sector has improved our understanding of the links between climate variability including extreme weather events and infectious diseases van lieshout et al epstein and mills mcmichael et al pascual et al patz and olson. despite various contentious issues see section new assessments of the role of climate change impacts on health have emerged since the tar. results from the mapping malaria risk in africa project mara arma show possible expansion and contraction depending on location of climatically suitable areas for malaria by and thomas et al. by and continuing into for example large part of the western sahel and much of southern central africa is shown to be likely to become unsuitable for malaria transmission. other assessments hartmann et al using climate change scenarios show that by changes in temperature and precipitation could alter the geographical distribution of malaria in zimbabwe with previously unsuitable areas of dense human population becoming suitable for transmission. strong southward expansion of the transmission zone will probably continue into south africa. using parasite survey data in conjunction with results from the hadcm gcm projected scenarios estimate potential increase mainly altitudinal in malaria distribution with little increase in the latitudinal extent of the disease by tanser et al. previously malaria free highland areas in ethiopia kenya rwanda and burundi could also experience modest incursions of malaria by the with conditions for transmission becoming highly suitable by the. by this period areas currently with low rates of malaria transmission in central somalia and the angolan highlands could also become highly suitable. among all scenarios the highlands of eastern africa and areas of southern africa are likely to become more suitable for transmission hartmann et al. as the rate of malaria transmission increases in the highlands the likelihood of epidemics may increase due to the lack of protective genetic modifications in the newly affected populations. severe malaria associated disease is more common in areas of low to moderate transmission such as the highlands of east africa and other areas of seasonal transmission. an epidemic in rwanda for example led to four fold increase in malaria admissions among pregnant women and five fold increase in maternal deaths due to malaria hammerich et al. the social and economic costs of malaria are also huge and include considerable costs to individuals and households as well as high costs at community and national levels holding and snow utzinger et al malaney et al. climate variability may also interact with other background stresses and additional vulnerabilities such as immuno africa chapter compromised populations hiv aids and conflict and war harrus and baneth in the future resulting in increased susceptibility and risk of other infectious diseases cholera and malnutrition. the potential for climate change to intensify or alter flood patterns may become major additional driver of future health risks from flooding few et al. the probability that sea level rise could increase flooding particularly on the coasts of eastern africa nicholls may also have implications for health mcmichael et al. relatively fewer assessments of possible future changes in animal health arising from climate variability and change have been undertaken. the demographic impacts on trypanosomiasis for example can arise through modification of the habitats suitable for the tsetse fly. climate change is also expected to affect both pathogen and vector habitat suitability through changes in moisture and temperature baylis and githeko. changes in disease distribution range prevalence incidence and seasonality can all be expected. rift valley fever epidemics evident during the el ni\xf1o event in east africa and associated with flooding could increase with higher frequency of el ni\xf1o events. finally heat stress and drought are likely to have further negative impacts on animal health and production of dairy products as already observed in the usa st pierre et al see also warren et al. agriculture results from various assessments of impacts of climate change on agriculture based on various climate models and sres emissions scenarios indicate certain agricultural areas that may undergo negative changes. it is estimated that by parts of the sahara are likely to emerge as the most vulnerable showing likely agricultural losses of between and of gdp. western and central africa are also vulnerable with impacts ranging from to. northern and southern africa however are expected to have losses of to mendelsohn et al. more recent assessments combining global and regional scale analysis impacts of climate change on growing periods and agricultural systems and possible livelihood implications have also been examined jones and thornton huntingford et al thornton et al. based on the fi scenario both the hadcm and echam gcms agree on areas of change in the coastal systems of southern and eastern africa figure. under both the and scenarios mixed rain fed semi arid systems are shown to be affected in the sahel as well as mixed rain fed and highland perennial systems in the great lakes region and in other parts of east africa. in the world marginal areas semi arid lands become more marginal with moderate impacts on coastal systems thornton et al see chapter section. such changes in the growing period are important especially when viewed against chapter africa figure. agricultural areas within the livestock only systems lga in arid and semi arid areas and rain fed mixed crop livestock systems mra in semi arid areas are projected by the hadcm gcm to undergo reduction in length of growing period to sres left and right emissions scenarios after thornton et al. possible changes in seasonality of rainfall onset of rain days and intensity of rainfall as indicated in sections and. other recent assessments using the fao iiasa agro ecological zones model aez in conjunction with iiasa world food system or basic linked system bsl as well as climate variables from five different gcms under four sres emissions scenarios show further agricultural impacts such as changes in agricultural potential by the fischer et al. by the significant decrease in suitable rain fed land extent and production potential for cereals is estimated under climate change. furthermore for the same projections for the same time horizon the area of arid and semi arid land in africa could increase by million hectares. the study shows that wheat production is likely to disappear from africa by the. on more local scale assessments have shown range of impacts. southern africa would be likely to experience notable reductions in maize production under possible increased enso conditions stige et al. in other countries additional risks that could be exacerbated by climate change include greater erosion deficiencies in yields from rain fed agriculture of up to during the period and reductions in crop growth period agoumi. recent study on south african agricultural impacts based on three scenarios indicates that crop net revenues will be likely to fall by as much as by with small scale farmers being the most severely affected. in egypt for example climate change could decrease national production of many crops ranging from for rice to for soybeans by compared with their production under current climate conditions eid et al. other agricultural activities could also be affected by climate change and variability including changes in the onset of rain days and the variability of dry spells reason et al see also chapter. however not all changes in climate and climate variability will be negative as agriculture and the growing seasons in certain areas for example parts of the ethiopian highlands and parts of southern africa such as mozambique may lengthen under climate change due to combination of increased temperature and rainfall changes thornton et al. mild climate scenarios project further benefits across african croplands for irrigated and especially dryland farms. however it is worth noting that even under these favourable scenarios populated regions of the mediterranean coastline central western and southern africa are expected to be adversely affected kurukulasuriya and mendelsohn. fisheries are another important source of revenue employment and proteins. climate change impacts on this sector however need to be viewed together with other human activities including impacts that may arise from governance of fresh and marine waters amcen unep. fisheries could be affected by different biophysical impacts of climate change depending on the resources on which they are based niang diop clark. of the order of to fisheries in north west africa and the east african lakes are shown to be impacted see ecf and potsdam institute warren et al. in coastal regions that have major lagoons or lake systems changes in freshwater flows and greater intrusion of salt water into lagoons will affect the species that are the basis of inland fisheries or aquaculture r\xe9publique de c\xf4te ivoire r\xe9publique du congo cury and shannon. in south africa fisheries could be affected by changes in estuaries coral reefs and upwelling with those that are dependent on the first two ecosystems being the most vulnerable clark. recent simulations based on the ncar gcm under doubling of carbon dioxide indicate that extreme wind and turbulence could decrease productivity by while turbulence will probably bring about decline in productivity in the spawning grounds and an increase of in the main feeding grounds clark et al. the impact of climate change on livestock farming in africa was examined by seo and mendelsohn. they showed that warming of could increase the income of small livestock farms by us billion. this increase is projected to come from stock expansion. further increases in temperature would then lead to gradual fall in net revenue per animal. warming of would probably increase the income of small livestock farms by about us billion largely as result of stock increases. by contrast warming of would be likely to decrease the income of large livestock farms by us billion and warming of would probably reduce income by as much as us billion. this reduction in income for large livestock farms would probably result both from decline in the number of stock and reduction in the net revenue per animal. increased precipitation of would be likely to reduce the income of small livestock farms by us billion mostly due to reduction in the number of animals kept. the same reduction in precipitation would be likely to reduce the income of large livestock farms by about us billion due to reduction both in stock numbers and in net revenue per animal. the study by seo and mendelsohn further shows that higher temperatures are beneficial for small farms that keep goats and sheep because it is easy to substitute animals that are heat tolerant. by contrast large farms are more dependent on species such as cattle which are not heat tolerant. increased precipitation is likely to be harmful to grazing animals because it implies shift from grassland to forests and an increase in harmful disease vectors and also shift from livestock to crops. assessing future trends in agricultural production in africa even without climate change remains exceedingly difficult contributions to gdp and impacts on gdp because of climate variability and other factors see for example mendelsohn et al tiffen arrow et al desta and coppock ferguson. while agriculture is key source of livelihood in africa there is evidence that off farm incomes are also increasing in some areas up to to of total incomes in some cases bryceson. urbanisation and off farm increases in income also seem to be contributing to reduced farm sizes. future scenarios and projections may thus need to include such changes as well as relevant population estimates allowing for the impact of hiv aids especially on farm labour productivity thornton et al",source_PDF:"./PDFs/2007 Impact,

present climate trends and variability in asia are generally characterised by increasing surface air temperature which is more pronounced during winter than in summer. increasing trends have been observed across the seven sub regions of asia. the observed increases in some parts of asia during recent decades ranged between less than to per century. increases in surface temperature are most pronounced in north asia savelieva et al izrael et al climate change in russia gruza and rankova. interseasonal interannual and spatial variability in rainfall trend has been observed during the past

events new evidences on recent trends particularly on the increasing tendency in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events in asia over the last century and into the st century are briefly discussed below and summarised in table. in south east asia extreme weather events associated with el ni\xf1o were reported to be more frequent and intense in the past years trenberth and hoar

related challenges in coming decades due to increases in water demands and soil moisture deficit associated with projected decline in precipitation tao et al. as land for agriculture becomes limited the need for more food in south asia could likely be met by increasing yields per unit of land water energy and time such as through precision farming. enhanced variability in hydrological characteristics will likely continue to affect grain supplies and food security in many nations of asia. intensification of agriculture will be the most likely means to meet the food requirements of asia which is likely to be invariably affected by projected climate change. the limited herbaceous production heat stress from higher temperature and limited water intake due to decrease in rainfall could cause reduced milk yields in animals and an increased incidence of some diseases. recent studies suggest reduction of primary production in the tropical oceans because of changes in oceanic circulation in warmer atmosphere. modelling study showed significant large scale changes of skipjack tuna habitat in the equatorial pacific under projected warming scenario loukos et al. increased frequency of el ni\xf1o events could likely lead to measurable declines in fish larvae abundance in coastal waters of south and south east asia. in contrast the northern shrimp will likely decrease with rise in sea surface temperatures acia. the impact of climate change on asian fishery depends on the complicated food chains in the surrounding oceans which are likely to be disturbed by the climate change. fisheries at higher elevations are likely to be adversely affected by lower availability of oxygen due to rise in surface air temperatures. in the plains the timing and amount of precipitation could also affect the migration of fish species from the river to the floodplains for spawning dispersal and growth fao. future changes in ocean currents sea level sea water temperature salinity wind speed and direction strength of upwelling the mixing layer thickness and predator response to climate change have the potential to substantially alter fish breeding habitats and food supply for fish and ultimately the abundance of fish populations in asian waters ipcc. large uncertainties in our understanding as to how the regional climate change will impact the food supply and demand in asia continue to prevail in spite of recent scientific advances. because of increasing interdependency of global food system the impact of climate change on future food supply and demand in

affected cambodia fischer et al. however increasing urbanisation and population in asia will likely result in increased food demand and reduced supply due to limited availability of cropland area and yield declines projected in most cases murdiyarso wang lin et al. the global cereal prices have been projected to increase more than three fold by the as consequence of decline in net productivity due

assessment of potential impacts of climate and co changes at local regional and national scales in both australia and new zealand. overall these emphasise the vulnerability of cropping and the potential for regional differences. impacts of climate change on pests diseases and weeds and their effects on crops remain uncertain since few experimental or modelling studies have been performed chakraborty et al. in new zealand for crops such as wheat the co response is likely to more than compensate for moderate increase in temperature jamieson et al see section. the net impact in

co and climate change in the ipcc sres scenarios howden and jones in conjunction with crop model recently validated for its co response for current wheat varieties reyenga et al asseng et al. south western australian regions are likely to have significant yield reductions by increased yield very unlikely. in contrast regions in north eastern australia are likely to have moderate increases in yield unlikely to have substantial yield reductions. there is substantial risk to the industry as maximum potential increases in crop value are limited to about or us billion yr but maximum potential losses are large about or us billion yr figure. however adaptation through changing planting dates and varieties is likely to be highly effective the median benefit is projected to be us million yr

adaptive capacity but they become vulnerable if global warming exceeds. the three key vulnerability factors identified in article of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc natural ecosystems sustainable development and food security are also shown in figure. when these climate change impacts are combined with other non climate trends see section there are some serious implications for sustainability in both australia and new zealand. climate change is very likely to threaten natural ecosystems with extinction of some species. there are limited planned adaptation options but the resilience of many ecosystems can be enhanced by reducing non climatic stresses such as water pollution habitat fragmentation and invasive species. in river catchments where increasing urban and rural water demand has already exceeded sustainable levels of supply ongoing and proposed adaptation strategies see section are likely to buy some time. continued rates of coastal development are likely to require tighter planning and regulation if they are to remain sustainable. climate change is very likely to increase peak energy demand during heatwaves posing challenges for sustainable energy supply. substantial public health and community response is likely to be needed in order to avoid an increase of several thousand heat related deaths per year. large shifts in the geographical distribution of agriculture and its services are very likely. farming of marginal land in drier regions is likely to become unsustainable due to water shortages new biosecurity hazards environmental degradation and social disruption. in areas that are likely to become wetter and less frosty it may be possible to grow new crops or those displaced from other regions. adaptation has the capacity to capture these benefits they are unlikely to accrue without investment in the adaptation process. food security is very likely to remain robust box. climate change adaptation in coastal areas australia and new zealand have very long coastlines with ongoing development and large and rapidly growing populations in the coastal zone. this situation is placing intense pressure on land and water resources and is increasing vulnerability to climatic variations including storm surges droughts and floods. major challenge facing both countries is how to adapt to changes in climate reduce vulnerability and yet achieve sustainable development. this bay is characterised by narrow coastal zone with two of the fastest growing districts of new zealand. combined population growth was over the period to centred on the cities of tauranga and whakatane. by the population is projected to increase to times. beachfront locations demand the highest premiums on the property market but face the

be immediate especially when they also address climate variability. many adaptation options can be implemented now for australia and new zealand at personal local and regional scales. enhancing society response capacity through the pursuit of sustainable development pathways is one way of promoting both adaptation and mitigation see chapter. key uncertainties and research priorities assessment of impacts is hampered because of uncertainty in climate change projections at the local level in rainfall rate of sea level rise and extreme weather events. research priorities for these are identified in the ipcc working group fourth assessment report ipcc. other uncertainties stem from an incomplete knowledge of natural and human system dynamics and limited knowledge of adaptive capacity constraints and options allen consulting group. more needs to be done to assess vulnerability within risk assessment framework. based on the information presented in this chapter the main research priorities are assessed to fall into four categories assessing impacts of climate change and vulnerability for critical systems water impacts and optimum adaptation strategies for projected

temperature is expected to increase much more in southern and central europe than in northern europe r\xe4is\xe4nen et al kjellstr\xf6m et al. kjellstr\xf6m shows that in summer the warming of large parts of central southern and eastern europe may be more closely connected to higher temperatures on warm days than to general warming. large increase is also expected for yearly minimum temperature across most of europe which at many locations exceeds the average winter warming by factor of two to three. much of the warming in winter is connected to higher temperatures on cold days which indicates decrease in winter temperature variability. an increase in the lowest winter temperatures although large would primarily mean that current cold extremes would decrease. in contrast large increase in the highest summer temperatures would expose europeans to unprecedented high temperatures. and kjellstr\xf6m all found substantial increase in the intensity of daily precipitation events. this holds even for areas with decrease in mean precipitation such as central europe and the mediterranean. impact over the mediterranean region during summer is not clear due to the strong convective rainfall component and its great spatial variability llasat. palmer and r\xe4is\xe4nen estimate that the probability of extreme winter precipitation exceeding two standard deviations above normal

found an increase in short duration to days summer rainfall events in slovakia of up to for summer warming. conclude that the future european summer climate would experience pronounced increase in year to year variability and thus higher incidence of heatwaves and droughts. estimated that countries in central europe would experience the same number of hot days as currently occur in southern europe and that mediterranean droughts would start earlier in the year and last longer. the mediterranean and even much of eastern europe may experience an increase in dry periods by the late st century polemio and casarano. the longest yearly dry spell could increase by as much as especially over france and central europe. however there is some recent evidence lenderink et al that these projections for droughts and heatwaves may be slightly over estimated due to the of soil moisture too small soil storage capacity resulting in soil drying out too easily in regional climate models. regarding extreme winds rockel and woth and leckebusch and ulbrich found an increase in extreme wind speeds for western and central europe although the changes were not statistically significant for all months of the year. found that extreme wind speeds increased for the area between and except over and south of the alps. conclude that this could generate more north sea storms leading to increases in storm surges along the north sea coast especially in the netherlands germany and denmark. non climate trends the european population is expected to decline by about over the period from to un. the relative overall stability of the population of europe is due to population growth in western europe alone mainly from immigration sardon. presently cee and russia have surplus of deaths over births with the balance of migration being positive only in russia. there is general decline in old age mortality in most european countries janssen et al although there has been reduction in life expectancy in russia during the. the low birth rate and increase in duration of life lead to an overall older population. the proportion of the population over years of age in the eu is expected to increase from in to in which will likely affect vulnerability in recreational see section and health aspects see section. the sres scenarios see chapter section for socio economic development have been adapted to european conditions parry holman et al abildtrup et al. electricity consumption in the eu is projected to continue growing twice as fast as the increase in total energy consumption eea primarily due to higher comfort levels and larger dwellings increasing demand for space heating and cooling which will have consequences for electricity demand during summer see section. assumptions about future european land use and the environmental impact of human activities depend greatly on the development and adoption of new technologies. for the sres scenarios it has been estimated that increases in crop productivity relative to could range between and depending on the time slice to and scenario ewert et al. these increases were found to be smallest for the and highest for the fi scenario. temporally and spatially explicit future scenarios of european land use have been developed for the four core sres scenarios schr\xf6ter et al rounsevell et al. these scenarios show large declines in agricultural land area resulting primarily from the assumptions about technological development and its effect on europe chapter crop yield rounsevell et al although climate change may also play role see section. the expansion of urban area is similar between the scenarios and forested areas also increase in all scenarios schr\xf6ter et al. the scenarios showed decreases in european cropland for of to and decreases in grassland of to rounsevell et al. this decline in agricultural area will mean that land resources will be available for other uses such as biofuel production and nature reserves. over the shorter term up to changes in agricultural land area may be small van meijl et al. key future impacts and vulnerabilities the wide range of climate change impacts and vulnerabilities expected in europe is summarised in figure and table. water resources it is likely that climate change will have range of impacts on water resources. projections based on various emissions scenarios and general circulation models gcms show that annual runoff increases in atlantic and northern europe werritty andr\xe9asson et al and decreases in central mediterranean and eastern europe chang et al etchevers et al menzel and b\xfcrger iglesias et al. most of the hydrological impact studies reported here are based on global rather than regional climate models. annual average runoff is projected to increase in northern europe north of by approximately to up to the and to up to the for the sres and scenarios and climate scenarios from two different climate models alcamo et al figure. meanwhile in southern europe south of runoff decreases by to up to the and by to up to the for the same set of assumptions. the projected changes in annual river basin discharge by the are likely to be affected as much by climate variability as by climate change. groundwater recharge is likely to be reduced in central and eastern europe eitzinger et al with larger reduction in valleys kr\xfcger et al and lowlands in the hungarian steppes somly\xf3dy. studies show an increase in winter flows and decrease in summer flows in the rhine middelkoop and kwadijk slovakian rivers szolgay et al the volga and central and eastern europe oltchev et al. it is likely that glacier retreat will initially enhance summer flow in the rivers of the chapter europe figure. change in annual river runoff between the baseline period and two future time slices and for the scenarios alcamo et al. alps however as glaciers shrink summer flow is likely to be significantly reduced hock et al by up to zierl and bugmann. summer low flow may decrease by up to in central europe eckhardt and ulbrich and by up to in some rivers in southern europe santos et al. changes in the water cycle are likely to increase the risk of floods and droughts. projections under the ipcc is scenario similar to sres ipcc and two gcms lehner et al indicate that the risk of floods increases in northern central and eastern europe while the risk of drought increases mainly in southern europe table. increase in intense short duration precipitation in most of europe is likely to lead to increased risk of flash floods eea. increasing flood risk from climate change could be magnified by increases in impermeable surface due to urbanisation de roo et al and modified by changes in vegetation cover robinson et al in small catchments. the effects of land use on floods in large catchments are still being debated. the more frequent occurrence of high floods increases the risk to areas currently protected by dykes. the increasing volume of floods and peak discharge would make it more difficult for reservoirs to store high runoff and prevent floods. increasing drought risk for western europe great britain fowler and kilsby is primarily caused by climate change for southern and eastern europe increasing risk from climate change would be amplified by an increase in water withdrawals lehner et al. the regions most prone to an increase in drought risk are the mediterranean portugal spain and some parts of central and eastern europe where the highest increase in irrigation water demand is projected d\xf6ll donevska and dodeva. irrigation requirements are likely to become substantial in countries ireland where demand now hardly exists holden et al. it is likely that due to both climate change and increasing water withdrawals the river basin area affected by severe water stress withdrawal availability will increase and lead to increasing competition for available water resources alcamo et al schr\xf6ter et al. under the is scenario the percentage of river basin area in the severe water stress category increases from today to by the lehner et al. the number of additional people living in water stressed watersheds in the eu plus switzerland and norway is likely to increase to between million and million based on climate projected by the hadcm gcm under the and emissions scenarios

including variations in the seasonality of coastal climates winter wind speeds and patterns of storminess and coastal flooding in north west europe lozano et al stone and orford yan et al. for europe atlantic coasts and shelf seas the nao also has strong influence on the dynamic sea surface height and geographic distribution of sea level rise woolf et al as well as some relation to coastal flooding and water levels in the caspian sea lal et al. most sres based climate scenarios show continuation of the recent positive phase of the nao for the first decades of the st century with significant impacts on coastal areas cubasch et al hurrell et al. wind driven waves and storms are seen as the primary drivers of short term coastal processes on many european coasts smith et al.

become vulnerable endangered critically endangered or committed to extinction by if unable to disperse thuiller et al. under the most severe climate scenario and assuming that species could adapt through dispersal of the species considered would become critically endangered and committed to extinction. according to these analyses the range of plants is very likely to expand northward and contract in southern european mountains and in the mediterranean basin. an assessment of european fauna indicated that the majority of amphibian to and reptile to species could expand their range under various sres scenarios if dispersal was unlimited ara\xfajo et al. however if unable to disperse then the range of most species would become smaller especially in the iberian peninsula and france. species in the uk south eastern europe and southern scandinavia are projected to benefit from more suitable climate although dispersal limitations may prevent them from occupying new suitable areas figure. consistent with these results another europe wide study of species of plants insects birds and mammals found that species would generally shift from the south west to the north east berry et al harrison et al. endemic plants and vertebrates in the mediterranean basin are also particularly vulnerable to climate change malcolm et al. habitat fragmentation is also likely to increase because of both climate and land use changes del barrio et al. currently species richness in inland freshwater systems is highest in central europe declining towards the south and north because of periodic droughts and salinisation declerck et al. increased projected runoff and lower risk of drought in the north will benefit the fauna of these systems lake daufresne et al but increased drought in the south will have the opposite effect alvarez cobelas et al. higher temperatures are likely to lead to increased species richness in freshwater ecosystems in northern europe and decreases in parts of south western europe guti\xe9rrez teira. invasive species may increase in the north mckee et al. cold adapted species will be forced further north and upstream some may eventually disappear from europe daufresne et al eisenreich. sea level rise is likely to have major impacts on biodiversity. increased sea temperatures may also trigger large scale disease related mortality events of dolphins in the mediterranean and of seals in europe geraci and lounsbury. seals that rely on ice for breeding are also likely to suffer considerable habitat loss harwood. sea level rise will reduce habitat availability for bird species that nest or forage in low lying coastal areas. this is particularly important for the populations of shorebirds that breed in the arctic and then winter on european coasts rehfisch and crick. lowered water tables and increased anthropogenic use and abstraction of water from inland wetlands are likely to cause serious problems for the populations of migratory birds and bats that use these areas while on migration within europe and between europe and africa robinson et al. agriculture and fisheries crops and livestock the effects of climate change

better cropping practices might far outweigh the effects of climate change ewert et al. increasing crop yield and decreasing or stabilising food and fibre demand could lead to decrease in total agricultural land area in europe rounsevell et al. some crops that currently grow mostly in southern europe maize sunflower and soybeans will become viable further north or at higher altitude areas in the south audsley et al. in particular in the european mediterranean region increases in the frequency of extreme climate events during specific crop development stages heat stress during flowering period rainy days during sowing time together with higher rainfall intensity and longer dry spells are likely to reduce the yield of summer crops sunflower. projections made for winter wheat showed that climate change beyond may lead to decrease in nitrate leaching from agricultural land over large parts of eastern europe and some smaller areas in spain and an increase in the uk and in other parts of europe olesen et al. an increase in the frequency of severe heat stress in britain is expected to enhance the risk of mortality of pigs and broiler chickens grown in intensive livestock systems turnpenny et al. increased frequency of droughts along the atlantic coast ireland may reduce the productivity of forage crops such that they are no longer sufficient for livestock at current

fertility in northern russia. feasible long term adaptation measure is to change the allocation of agricultural land according to its changing suitability under climate change. large scale abandonment of cropland in europe estimated under the sres scenarios rounsevell et al may provide an opportunity to increase the cultivation of bioenergy crops schr\xf6ter et al. found that different types of agricultural adaptation intensification extensification and abandonment may be appropriate under different ipcc sres scenarios and at different locations. it is indisputable that the reform of eu agricultural policies will be an important vehicle for encouraging european agriculture to adapt to climate change olesen and bindi and for reducing the vulnerability of the agricultural sector metzger et al. at the small scale there is evidence that fish and shellfish farming industries are adapting their technology and operations to changing climatic conditions for example by expanding offshore and selecting optimal culture sites for shellfish cages p\xe9rez et al. however adaptation is more difficult for smaller coastal based fishery businesses which do not have the option to sail long distances to new fisheries as compared to larger businesses with long distance fleets. at the larger scale adaptation options have not yet been considered in important policy institutions such as the european common fisheries policy cfp although its production quotas and technical measures provide an ideal platform for such adaptation actions. another major adaptation option is to factor the long term potential impacts of climate change into the planning for new marine protected areas soto. adaptation strategies should eventually be integrated into comprehensive plans for managing coastal areas of europe. however these plans are lacking especially around the mediterranean and need to be developed urgently coccossis. energy and transport wide variety of adaptation measures are available in the energy sector ranging from the redesign of the energy supply system to the modification of human behaviour santos et al. the sensitivity of european energy systems to climate change could be reduced by enhancing the interconnection capacity of electricity grids and by using more decentralised electric generation systems and local micro grids arnell et al. another type of adaptation would be to reduce the exposure of energy users and producers to impacts of unfavourable climate through the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions for example by reducing overall energy use. this can be accomplished through various energy conservation measures such as energy saving building codes and low electricity standards for new appliances increasing energy prices and through training and public education. over the medium to long term shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy use will be an effective adaptive measure hanson et al. clearly one aspect of adaptation may be through measures to mitigate emissions from transport through cleaner technologies and adapting behaviour national assessment synthesis team aeat highways agency. there is clearly need for capacity building in the response to incidents risk assessments developments in maintenance renewal practice and design standards for new infrastructure highways agency mayor of london. assessment of the costs and benefits of adapting existing infrastructure or raising standards in the design of new vehicles and infrastructure to improve system resilience and reliability to the range of potential impacts should consider the wider economic and social impacts of disruption to the transport system. tourism and recreation variety of adaptation measures are available to the tourism industry wto hanson et al. regarding winter tourism compensating for reduced snowfall by artificial snowmaking is already common practice for coping with year to year snow pack variability. however this adaptation strategy is likely to be economic only in the short term or in the case of very high elevation resorts in mountain regions and may be ecologically undesirable. new leisure industries such as grass skiing or hiking could compensate for any income decrease experienced by the ski industry due to snow deterioration fukushima et al. regarding coastal tourism the protection of resorts from sea level rise may be feasible by constructing barriers or by moving tourism infrastructure further back from the coast pinnegar et al. in the mediterranean region the likely reduction of tourism during the hotter summer months may be compensated for by promoting changes in the temporal pattern of seaside tourism for example by encouraging visitors during the cooler months amelung and viner. the increasing new climate related risks to health availability of water energy demand and infrastructure are likely to be dealt with through efficient co operation with local governments. another adaptive measure for european tourism in general is promoting new forms of tourism such as eco tourism or cultural tourism and placing greater emphasis on man made rather than natural attractions which are less sensitive to weather conditions hanson et al. it is also likely that people will adapt autonomously and reactively by changing their recreation and travel behaviour in response to the new climatic conditions sievanen et al. property insurance the insurance industry has several approaches for adapting to the growing climate related risk to property. insurers are beginning to use geographical information systems gis to provide information needed to adjust insurance tariffs to climate related risks dlugolecki munich re although the uncertainty of future climate change is an obvious problem in making these chapter europe adjustments. insurers are also involved in discussions of measures for climate change mitigation and adaptation including measures such as more stringent control of flood plain development and remedial measures for damages derived from weather action and extreme events abi dlugolecki and keykhah. an obvious adaptation measure against property damage is to improve construction techniques so that buildings and infrastructure are more robust to extreme climate events. however even if building techniques are immediately improved the benefits will not be instantaneous because current building stock has long remaining lifetime. hence these buildings would not be replaced for many years by more resilient structures unless they are retrofitted. while retrofitting can be an effective adaptation measure it also has drawbacks. costs are often high residents are disrupted and poor enforcement of building regulations and construction practices could lead to unsatisfactory results. human health risks posed by weather extremes are the most important in terms of requiring society preparedness ebi hassi and rytk\xf6nen menne menne and ebi. many european countries and cities have developed such measures especially after the summer of koppe et al ministerio de sanidad consumo menne see also chapter box. other measures are aimed at the mitigation of heat islands through urban planning the adaptation of housing design to local climate and expanding air conditioning shifts in work patterns and mortality monitoring keatinge et al ballester et al johnson et al marttila et al penning rowsell et al. principal strategies to lessen the risks of flooding include public flood warning systems evacuations from lowlands waterproof assembling of hospital equipment and the establishment of decision hierarchies between hospitals and administrative authorities ohl and tapsell hajat et al eea who hedger marttila et al penning rowsell et al. case studies heatwave of severe heatwave over large parts of europe in extended from june to mid august raising summer temperatures by to in most of southern and central europe figure. the warm anomalies in june lasted throughout

increase in mean temperature and temperature variability meehl and tebaldi pal et al sch\xe4r et al figure. as such the heatwave resembles simulations by regional climate models of summer temperatures in the latter part of the st century under the scenario beniston. anthropogenic warming may therefore already have increased the risk of heatwaves such as the one experienced in stott et al. the

colder interior has thickened most probably as result of recently high precipitation rates while the coastal zone has been thinning. thus some studies suggest that overall the ice sheet is growing in

of many coastal glaciers krabill et al howat et al ekstrom et al luckman et al rignot and kanagaratnam suggest that thinning is now dominating the mass balance of the entire ice sheet. warming thawing and decrease in areal extent of terrain underlain by permafrost are expected in response to climatic change in the st century sazonova et al euskirchen et al lemke et al. results from models forced with range of ipcc climate scenarios indicate that by the mid st century the permafrost area in the northern hemisphere is likely to decrease by to largely due to the thawing of permafrost in the southern portions of the sporadic and discontinuous zones but also due to increasing patchiness in areas that currently have continuous permafrost anisimov and belolutskaia. projected changes in the depth of seasonal thawing base of the active layer are uniform neither in space nor in time. in the next three decades active layer depths are likely to be within to of their present values over most of the permafrost area by the middle of the century the depth of seasonal thawing may increase on average by to and by and more in the northernmost locations and by it is likely to increase by to and more over all permafrost areas anisimov and belolutskaia instanes et al. antarctic current and projected changes in the antarctic ice sheet are discussed in greater detail elsewhere lemke et al and are only summarised here. recent changes in volume of the antarctic ice sheet are much better mapped and understood than they were in the tar but competing theories over the causes still limits confidence in prediction of the future changes. the ice sheet on the antarctic peninsula is probably alone in showing clear response to contemporary climate change see section while the larger west antarctic and east antarctic ice sheets are showing changes whose attribution to climate change are not clear but cannot be ruled out. in west antarctica there is suggestion that the dramatic recent thinning of the ice sheet throughout the amundsen sea sector is the result of recent ocean change payne et al shepherd et al but as yet there are too few oceanographic measurements to confirm this interpretation. indeed there is evidence that deglaciation of some parts of west antarctica as response to climate change at the end of the last glacial period is not yet complete stone et al. there are still competing theories but the now clear evidence of ice sheet change has reinvigorated debate about whether we should expect deglaciation of part of the west antarctic ice sheet on century to

thickening davis et al while others indicate little change zwally et al velicogna and wahr wingham et al. permafrost in ice free areas seasonal snow cover and lake ice do exist in antarctica but in such small areas that they are only discussed in respect to particular impacts. key future impacts and vulnerabilities freshwater systems and their management arctic freshwater systems and historical changes some freshwater systems exist wholly within the arctic but many others are fed by river and lake systems further south. the latter includes five of the world largest river catchments which act as major conduits transporting water heat sediment nutrients contaminants and biota into the arctic. for these systems it will be the basin wide changes that will determine the arctic impacts. historically the largest changes to northern river systems have been produced by flow regulation much of it occurring in the headwaters of arctic rivers. for canada and russia it is these northward flowing rivers that hold the greatest remaining potential for large scale hydroelectric development shiklomanov et al prowse et al. similar to some expected effects of climate change the typical effect of hydroelectric flow regulation is to increase winter flow but also to decrease summer flow and thereby change overall inter seasonal variability. in the case of the largest arctic flowing river in north america the mackenzie river separating the effects of climate change from regulation has proven difficult because of the additional dampening effects on flow produced by natural storage release effects of major lake systems gibson et al peters et al. for some major russian rivers ob and yenisei seasonal effects of hydroelectric regulation have been noted as being primarily responsible for observed trends in winter discharge that were previously thought to be result of climatic effects yang et al. by contrast winter flow increases on the lena river have resulted primarily from increased winter precipitation and warming yang et al berezovskaya et al. spatial patterns in timing of flows however have not been consistent with adjacent major siberian rivers showing both earlier lena yang et al and later yenisei yang et al spring flows over the last years. although precipitation changes are often suspected of causing many changes in river runoff sparse precipitation monitoring network in the arctic makes such linkages very difficult walsh et al. seasonal precipitation runoff responses could be further obscured by the effects of permafrost thaw and related alterations to flow pathways and transfer times serreze et al berezovskaya et al zhang et al. chapter polar regions arctic and antarctic over the last half century the combined flow from the six largest eurasian rivers has increased by approximately or an average of km yr peterson et al. the precise controlling factors remain to be identified but effects of ice melt from permafrost forest fires and dam storage have been eliminated as being responsible mcclelland et al. increased runoff to the arctic ocean from circumpolar glaciers ice caps and ice sheets has also been noted to have occurred in the late th century and to be comparable to the increase in combined river inflow from the largest pan arctic rivers dyurgerov and carter. the arctic contains numerous types of lentic still water systems ranging from shallow tundra ponds to large lakes. seasonal shifts in flow ice cover precipitation and inputs of sediment and nutrients have all been identified as climate related factors controlling their biodiversity storage regime and carbon methane source sink status wrona et al. significant number of records from lakes in the circumpolar arctic have shown synchronous changes in biological community composition and parameters associated with climate driven regime shifts in increasing mean annual and summer temperatures and corresponding changes in thermal stratification stability and ice cover duration korhola et al ruhland et al pienitz et al smol et al prowse et al. permafrost plays large role in the hydrology of lentic systems primarily through its influence on substrate permeability and surface ponding of water hinzman et al. appreciable changes have been observed in lake abundance and area over km zone of siberia during an approximate three decade period at the end of the last century see figure smith et al. the spatial pattern of lake disappearance strongly suggests that permafrost thawing is driving the changes. impacts on physical regime changes in arctic freshwater systems will have numerous impacts on the physical regime of the arctic particularly affecting hydrological extremes global feedbacks and contaminant pathways. hydrological models based on atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms have consistently also predicted increases in flow for the major arctic river systems with the largest increases during the cold season miller and russell arora and boer mokhov et al georgievsky et al. less clear is what may occur during the summer months with some results suggesting that flow may actually decrease because of evaporation exceeding precipitation walsh et al. reductions in summer flow could be enhanced for many watersheds because of increases in as dominant terrestrial vegetation shifts from non transpiring tundra lichens to various woody species callaghan et al. co induced reductions in transpiration might offset this and have been suggested as being responsible for some th century changes in global runoff gedney et al. since arctic river flow is the major component of the freshwater budget of the arctic ocean lewis et al it is important to the supply of freshwater to the north atlantic and related effects on the thermohaline circulation bindoff et al. the sum of various freshwater inputs to the arctic ocean has matched the amount and rate at which freshwater has accumulated in the north atlantic over the period to peterson et al. under greenhouse gas scenarios the total annual river inflow to the arctic ocean is expected to increase by approximately to by the late st century walsh et al. an additional source of future freshwater input will be from melting of large glaciers and ice caps most notably from greenland gregory et al dowdeswell. the cumulative effect of these increasing freshwater supplies on thermohaline circulation remains unclear but is critical area of concern loeng et al bindoff et al. warming is also forecast to cause reductions in river and lake ice cover which will lead to changes in lake thermal structures quality quantity of under ice habitat and effects on ice jamming and related flooding prowse et al. specific to the latter forecasts of earlier snowmelt freshets could create conditions more conducive to severe break up events prowse and beltaos although longer period of warming could also reduce severity smith. this effect however is likely to be offset on some large northward flowing rivers because of reduced regional contrasts in south to north temperatures and related hydrological and physical gradients prowse et al. projected changes of permafrost vegetation and river runoff may have noticeable impacts on river morphology acting through destabilisation of banks and slopes increased erosion and sediment supply and ultimately leading to the transformation between multi and single channel types. locations of siberian lakes that have disappeared after three decade period of rising soil and air temperatures changes registered from satellite imagery from early to overlaid on various permafrost types. the spatial pattern of lake disappearance suggests that permafrost thawing has driven the observed losses. that such transformations and also erosion events and flood risks occur especially at times of permafrost degradation bogaart and van balen vandenberghe. such changes are largely controlled by thresholds in sediment supply to the river and discharge vandenberghe. however historical examples have shown that variability in flow regime is less important than variability in sediment supply which is especially determined by the vegetation cover huisink et al vandenberghe and huisink. thus an increasingly denser vegetation cover may counter increased sediment discharge which has been modelled to rise in arctic rivers with both increases in air temperature and water discharge syvitski. various changes in arctic hydrology have the potential to effect large changes in the proportion of pollutants persistent organic pollutants and mercury that enter arctic aquatic systems either by solvent switching or solvent depleting processes macdonald et al. given that the arctic is predicted to be generally wetter the increase in loadings of particulates and contaminants that partition strongly into water might more than offset the reductions expected to accrue from reductions in global emissions macdonald et al. shifts in other hydrological regime components such as vegetation runoff patterns and thermokarst drainage hinzman et al all have the capacity to increase contaminant capture. changes in aquatic trophic structure and related rate functions see section have further potential to alter the accumulation of bio magnifying chemicals within food webs. ultimately the dispersal and geographical distribution patterns of aquatic species will be altered particularly for fish reist et al. extension of the ice free season may lead to decline in fish habitat availability and suitability particularly affecting species such as lake trout salvelinus namaycush that prefer colder waters hobbie et al reist et al. as water column dissolved organic carbon doc concentration increases penetration of damaging uv radiation and photochemical processing of organic material would decline although not as prominently in highly productive systems reist et al wrona et al. whether freshwater systems will function as net carbon sinks or sources depends on the complex interactions between temperature nutrient status and water levels frey and smith flanagan et al. this will allow for the dispersal and establishment of new aquatic communities in areas formerly dominated by terrestrial species wrona et al. as the permafrost thaws further surface waters will increasingly drain into groundwater systems leading to losses in freshwater habitat. many of these particularly fishes will be likely to out compete or prey upon established arctic species resulting in negative local effects on these reist et al. these southern emigrants to the arctic will also bring with them new parasites and or diseases to which arctic species are not adapted thereby increasing mortality wrona et al. distributions of anadromous fish which migrate up rivers from the sea to breed in freshwater will probably shift as oceanic conditions and freshwater drainage patterns are affected reist et al as will the geographical patterns of habitat use of migratory aquatic birds and mammals wrona et al. impacts on resource use and traditional economies livelihoods given the large hydrological changes

The potential risk to coral reefs from human-threat factors. Low risk (blue), medium risk (yellow) and high risk (red).Source: Bryant et al. (1998).",context:"simulations also show that changes in sediment supply can cause physical alteration of atoll islands by an equivalent or greater amount than by sea level rise alone. for instance chronic island erosion resulting from increased water depth across reefs with global warming and sea level rise is envisaged for some islands in the pacific dickinson while kench et al. present data and model which suggest that uninhabited islands of the maldives are morphologically resilient rather than fragile systems and are expected to persist under current scenarios of future climate change and sea level rise. the impact of the sumatran tsunami on such islands appears to confirm this resilience kench et al and implies that islands which have been subject to substantial human modification are inherently more vulnerable than those that have not been modified. daniel and abkowitz present the results of such an approach in the caribbean which involves the development of tools for integrating spatial and non spatial coastal data estimating long term beach erosion accretion trends and storm induced beach erosion at individual beaches identifying erosion sensitive beaches and mapping beach erosion hazards. coastal erosion on arctic islands has additional climate sensitivity through the impact of warming on permafrost and extensive ground ice which can lead to accelerated erosion and volume loss and the potential for higher wave energy if the diminished sea ice results in longer over water fetch see chapter section chapter section. while erosion is intuitively the most common response of island shorelines to sea level rise it should be recognised that coasts are not passive systems. instead they will respond dynamically in different ways dependent on many factors including the geological setting coastal type whether soft or hard shores the rate of sediment supply relative to rate of submergence sediment type sand or gravel presence or absence of natural shore protection structures such as beach rock or conglomerate outcrops presence or absence of biotic protection such as mangroves and other strand vegetation and the health of coral reefs. who suggest that mass coral mortality over the past decade at some sites in the seychelles has resulted in reduction in the level of the fringing reef surface consequent rise in wave energy over the reef and increased coastal erosion. global change is also creating number of other stress factors that are very likely to influence the health of coral reefs around islands as result of increasing sea surface temperature and sea level damage from tropical cyclones and possible decreases in growth rates due to the effects of higher co concentrations on ocean chemistry. impacts on coral reefs from those factors will not be uniform throughout the small island realm. in addition to these primarily climate driven factors the impacts of which are detailed in chapter section there are those associated mainly with other human activities which combine to subject island coral reefs to multiple stresses as illustrated in box. projected impacts of climate change include extended periods of drought and on the other hand loss of soil fertility and degradation as result of increased precipitation both of which will negatively impact on agriculture and food security. non climate change threats to coral reefs of small islands large number of non climate change stresses and disturbances mainly driven by human activities can impact coral reefs nystr\xf6m et al hughes et al. it has been suggested that the coral reef crisis is almost certainly the result of complex and synergistic interactions among global scale climatic stresses and local scale human imposed stresses buddemeier et al. four human threat factors coastal development marine pollution over exploitation and destructive fishing and sediment and nutrients from inland provide composite indicator of the potential risk to coral reefs associated with human activity for reef sites. their map figure identifies low risk blue medium risk yellow and high risk red sites the first being common in the insular central indian and pacific oceans the last in maritime south east asia and the caribbean archipelago. details of reefs at risk in the two highest risk areas have been documented by burke et al. and burke and maidens who indicate that about of the reefs in south east asia and in the caribbean are classed in the high to very high risk category. there are however significant local and regional differences in the scale and type of threats to coral reefs in both continental and small island situations. recognising that coral reefs are especially important for many small island states wilkinson notes that reefs on small islands are often subject to range of non climate impacts. there is another category of stress that may inadvertently result in damage to coral reefs the human component of poor governance goldberg and wilkinson. the potential risk to coral reefs from human threat factors. low risk blue medium risk yellow and high risk red. small islands chapter not all effects of climate change on agriculture are expected to be negative. for example increased temperatures in high latitude islands are likely to make conditions more suitable for agriculture and provide opportunities to enhance resilience of local food systems see also chapter section. if the intensity of tropical cyclones increases concomitant rise in significant damage to food crops and infrastructure is likely. changes in migration patterns and depth are two main factors affecting the distribution and availability of tuna during those periods and it is expected that changes in climate would cause migratory shifts in tuna aggregations to other locations mclean et al. the two main effects of climate change on tuna fishing are likely to be decline in the total stock and migration of the stock eastwards both of which will lead to changes in the catch in different countries. in contrast to agriculture the mobility of fish makes it difficult to estimate future changes in marine fish resources. furthermore since the life cycles of many species of commercially exploited fisheries range from freshwater to ocean water land based and coastal activities will also be likely to affect the populations of those species. coral reefs and other coastal ecosystems which may be severely affected by climate change will also have an impact on fisheries graham et al. however it is possible that in mid and high latitude islands higher temperature and the retreat and loss of snow cover could enhance conditions for the spread of invasive species and forest cover smith et al see also chapter section. with rapid climate change even greater numbers of introductions and enhanced colonisation by alien species are likely with consequent increases in impacts on these island ecosystems. climate related ecosystem effects are also already evident in the mid latitudes such as on the island of hokkaido japan where decrease in alpine flora has been reported kudo et al. there is also detectable influence on marine and terrestrial pathogens such as coral diseases and oyster pathogens linked to enso events harvell et al. these changes are in addition to coral bleaching which could become an annual or biannual event in the next to years or sooner without an increase in thermal tolerance of to sheppard donner et al. furthermore in the caribbean sea level rise is projected to cause decrease in turtle nesting habitat by up to fish et al. in these ecosystems anthropogenic climate change is likely to combine with past land use changes and biological invasions to drive several species such as endemic birds to extinction benning et al. this trend among hawaiian forest birds shows concordance with the spread of avian malaria which has doubled over decade at upper elevations and is associated with breeding of mosquitoes and warmer summertime air temperatures freed et al. in the event of increasing extreme events such as cyclones hurricanes see section forest biodiversity could be severely affected as adaptation responses on small islands are expected to be slow and impacts of storms may be cumulative. these authors show that resistance of trees to hurricane damage is not only correlated with individual and species characteristics but also with past disturbance history which suggests that individual storms cannot be treated as discrete independent events when interpreting the effects of hurricanes on forest structure. human settlements and well being the concentration of large settlements along with economic and social activities at or near the coast is well documented feature of small islands",source_PDF:"./PDFs/2007 Impact, adaption.pdf",image_page_number:709,chart_type:"map"},{image_id:70,caption:"Figure 16.3. The main steps of a community vulnerability and adaptation assessment and action approach.",context:"this approach requires community members to identify climate conditions relevant to them and to assess present and potential adaptive strategies. in this case local residents identified several adaptive measures including building seawall the provision of water drainage system and water tanks ban on tree clearing some relocation and renovations to existing infrastructure. enhancing adaptive capacity however involves more than just the identification of local options which need to be considered within the larger social political and economic processes. suggest that enhancing adaptive capacity will only be successful when it is integrated with other policies such as disaster preparedness land use planning environmental conservation coastal planning and national plans for sustainable development. given the urgency for adaptation in small island states there has been an increase in ad hoc stand alone projects rather than programmed or strategic approach to the funding of adaptation options and measures. it can be argued that successful adaptation in small islands will depend on supportive institutions finance information and technological support. however as noted by richards disciplinary and institutional barriers mean that synergies between climate change adaptation and poverty reduction strategies remain underdeveloped adger et al. note that climate change adaptation has implications for equity and justice because the impacts of climate change and resources for addressing these impacts are unevenly distributed. these issues are particularly applicable to small islands which have low capacity to deal with or adapt to such impacts. conclusions implications for sustainable development the economic social and environmental linkages between climate change and sustainable development and their implications for poverty alleviation have been highlighted in various studies hay et al huq and reid and these are highly relevant to small islands. most recently one of the key findings of major study suggested that climate change poses such serious threat to poor vulnerable developing countries that if left unchecked it will become major obstacle to continued poverty reduction stern. indeed it is true to say that many low lying small islands view climate change as one of the most important challenges to their achievement of sustainable development. for instance in the maldives majeed and abdulla argue that sea level rise would so seriously damage the fishing and tourism industries that gdp would be reduced by more than. in another atoll island setting ronneberg uses the marshall islands as case study to explain that the linkages between patterns of consumption and production and the effects of global climate change pose serious future challenges to improving the life of the populations of small island developing states. based on this case study ronneberg proposes number of innovative solutions including waste to energy and ocean thermal energy conversion systems which could promote the sustainable development of some small islands and at the same time strengthen their resilience in the face of climate change. the sustainable development of small islands which are not low lying and there are many of these is also likely to be seriously impacted by climate change although perhaps not to the same extent as the low islands. for example briguglio and cordina have shown that climate change impacts on the economic development of malta are likely to be widespread affecting all sectors of the economy but particularly tourism fishing and public utilities. sperling in an examination of poverty and climate change contends that the negative impacts of climate change are so serious that they threaten to undo decades of development efforts. he also argues that the combined experience of many international organisations suggests that the best way to address climate change impacts is by integrating adaptation measures into sustainable development strategies. in the context of the pacific small island states who suggest that the most desirable adaptive responses are those that augment actions which would be taken even in the absence of climate change due to their contributions to sustainable development. adaptation measures may be conducive to sustainable development even without the connection with climate change. the link between adaptation to climate change and sustainable development which leads to the lessening of pressure on natural resources improving environmental risk management and increasing the social well being of the poor may not only reduce the vulnerability of small islands to climate change but also may put them on the path towards sustainable development. mitigation measures could also be mainstreamed in sustainable development plans and actions. in this regard munasinghe argues that ultimately climate change solutions will need to identify and exploit synergies as well as seek to balance possible trade offs among the multiple objectives of development mitigation and adaptation policies. also argue that while climate change mitigation initiatives undertaken by pacific island countries will have insignificant consequences they should nevertheless be pursued because of their valuable contributions to sustainable development. but what is small island sustainable development about kerr prefaces this question by noting that sustainable development is often stated as an objective of management strategies for small islands though relatively little work has explicitly considered what sustainable development means in this context. she argues that the problems of small scale and isolation of specialised economies and of the opposing forces of globalisation and localisation may mean that current development in small islands may be unsustainable in terms of its longevity. on the other hand models of sustainable development may have something to offer islands in terms of internal management of resources although the islands may have limited control over exogenous threats or the economic small islands chapter drivers of development kerr. in this context the development of adaptation measures in response to climate change may provide an appropriate avenue to integrate both local and global forces towards island development that is sustainable providing that local communities are involved tran. another positive factor is that many small islands have considerable experience in adapting to climate variability. in the case of cyprus for example tsiourtis explains that the island has consistently taken steps to alleviate the adverse effects arising from water scarcity which is likely to be one of the important effects of climate change. this experience already features in development strategies adopted by cyprus. similar argument has also been made by briguglio with regard to the maltese islands referring to the islands exposure to climatic seasonal variability which historically has led to individuals and administrations taking measures associated with retreat accommodation and protection strategies. temperatures and precipitation rates in malta change drastically between mid winter and mid summer and this has led to the accumulation of considerable experience in adaptation to climate variability. capacity building for development of adaptation measures in small islands community approach capacity building for development of adaptation measures in pacific island countries uses community vulnerability and adaptation assessment and action approach. such an approach is participatory aims to better understand the nature of community vulnerability and identifies opportunities for strengthening the adaptive capacity of communities. it seeks to promote combination of bottom up and top down mechanisms for implementation and supports the engagement of local stakeholders at each stage of the assessment process. if successful this should enable integration or mainstreaming of adaptation into national development planning and local decision making processes. the main steps of this approach are outlined below figure. several pilot communities in the cook islands fiji samoa and vanuatu are already using this approach to analyse their options and decide on the best course of action to address their vulnerability and adaptation needs. the main steps of community vulnerability and adaptation assessment and action approach. chapter small islands however as mentioned earlier small islands face many constraints in trying to mainstream climate change into their sustainable development strategies. these include their very limited resources especially given the of overhead expenditures and hidden costs involved in adaptation measures particularly in infrastructural projects. another problem may relate to possible social and or political conflicts particularly to do with land use and resources westmacott though not exclusively lane. notwithstanding this observation most decisions regarding the critical issues of land use energy use and transportation infrastructure in small islands will not have any meaningful influence on the rate and magnitude of climate change worldwide. however they may have significant moral and ethical impact in the climate change arena as well as contributing to reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions and to small island sustainable development. key uncertainties and research gaps small islands are sensitive to climate change and sea level rise and adverse consequences of climate change and variability are already reality for many inhabitants of small islands. this assessment has found that many small islands lack adequate observational data and as noted in the tar outputs from aogcms are not of sufficiently fine resolution to provide specific information for islands. these deficiencies need to be addressed so that remaining uncertainties can be reduced and national and local scale adaptation strategies for small islands better defined. as the impacts of climate change become increasingly evident autonomous small islands like other countries will probably be confronted with the need to implement adaptation strategies with greater urgency. however for these strategies to be effective they should reflect the fact that natural and human systems in small islands are being simultaneously subjected to other non climate stresses including population growth competition for limited resources ecosystem degradation and the dynamics of social change and economic transformation. therefore responses to climate change need to be properly coordinated and integrated with socio economic development policies and environmental conservation. the enhancement of resilience at various levels of society through capacity building efficient resource allocation and the mainstreaming of climate risk management into development policies at the national and local scale could constitute key element of the adaptation strategy. observations and climate change science ongoing observation is required to monitor the rate and magnitude of changes and impacts over different spatial and temporal scales. in situ observations of sea level should be strengthened to understand the components of relative sea level change on regional and local scales. while there has been considerable progress in regional projections of sea level since the tar such projections have not been fully utilised in small islands because of the greater uncertainty attached to them as opposed to global projections. since the tar it has also been recognised that other climate change induced factors will probably have impacts on coastal systems and marine territories of small islands including rises in sea temperature and changes in ocean chemistry and wave climate. the monitoring of these and other marine variables in the seas adjacent to small islands would need to be expanded and projections developed. although future projections of mean air temperature are rather consistent among climate models projections for changes in precipitation tropical cyclones and wind direction and strength which are critical concerns for small islands remain uncertain. projections based on outputs at finer resolution are needed to inform the development of reliable climate change scenarios for small islands. regional climate models rcms and statistical downscaling techniques may prove to be useful tools in this regard as the outputs are more applicable to countries at the scale of small islands. these approaches could lead to improved vulnerability assessments and the identification of more appropriate adaptation options. supporting efforts by small islands and their partners to arrest the decline of and expand observational networks should be continued. the pacific islands global climate observing system pi gcos and the oceanographic commission sub commission for the caribbean and adjacent regions global ocean observing system iocaribe goos are two examples of regional observing networks whose coverage should be expanded to cover other island regions. these need to be investigated and modelled over the range of island types covering different geology topography and land cover and in light of the most recent climate change scenarios and projections. impacts and adaptation decade ago many small islands were the subject of vulnerability assessments to climate change. such assessments were based on simplistic scenarios with an emphasis on sea level rise and the application of common methodology that was applied to many small islands throughout the world. since then the momentum for vulnerability and impact studies appears to have declined such that in the present assessment we can cite few robust investigations of climate change impacts on small islands using more recent scenarios and more precise projections. developing renewed international agenda to assess the vulnerability of small islands based on the most recent projections and newly available tools would provide small islands with firmer basis for future planning. our assessment has identified several

sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. nonetheless they all emphasise one or more of the following critical elements identifying what to develop identifying what to sustain characterising links between entities to be sustained and entities to be developed and envisioning future contexts for these links nrc. the essence of sustainable development throughout is meeting fundamental human needs in ways that preserve the life support systems of the planet kates et al. its strength lies in reconciling real and perceived conflicts between the economy and the environment and between the present and the future nrc. authors have emphasised the economic ecological and human social dimensions that are the pillars of sustainable development robinson and herbert munasinghe et al kates et al. the economic dimension aims at improving human welfare such as real income. the ecological dimension seeks to protect the integrity and resilience of ecological systems and the social dimension focuses on enriching human relationships and attaining individual and group aspirations munasinghe and swart as well as addressing concerns related to social justice and promotion of greater societal awareness of environmental issues riordan. the concept of sustainable development has permeated mainstream thinking over the past two decades especially after the earth summit where governments adopted agenda undsd. ten years later the world summit on sustainable development wssd made it clear that sustainable development had become widely held social and political goal. even though as illustrated in asia by the institute for global environmental strategies iges implementation remains problematic there is broad international agreement that development programmes should foster transitions to paths that meet human needs while preserving the earth life support systems and alleviating hunger and poverty icsu by integrating these three dimensions economic ecological and human social of sustainable development. researchers and practitioners in merging fields such as sustainability science kates et al multi scale decision analysis adger et al and sustainomics munasinghe et al seek to increase our understanding of how societies can do just that. climate change adds to the list of stressors that challenge our ability to achieve the ecologic economic and social objectives that define sustainable development. chapter builds on the assessments in earlier chapters to note the potential for climate change to affect development paths themselves. figure locates its key topics schematically in the context of the three pillars of sustainable development. topics shown in the centre of the triangle the three legged stool of sustainable development are linked with all three pillars. other topics placed outside the triangle are located closer to one leg or another. the arrows leading from the centre indicate that adaptation to climate change can influence the processes that join the pillars rather than the individual pillars themselves. for example the technical and economic aspects of renewable resource management could illustrate efforts to support sustainable development by working with the economy ecology connection all nested within decision space of other global development pressures including poverty. section begins with brief review of the current understanding of impacts and adaptive capacity as described earlier see chapter. section assesses impacts and adaptation in the context of multiple stresses. section focuses on links to environmental quality and explores the notion of adding climate change impacts and adaptation to the list of components of environmental impact assessments. section addresses implications for risk hazards and disaster management including the challenge of reducing vulnerability to current climate variability and adapting to long term climate change. section assesses the implications for achieving sustainable development across various time scales. section considers opportunities co benefits and challenges for climate change adaptation and for linking or mainstreaming adaptation into national and regional development planning processes. this entire chapter should be read with the recognition that the first chapters of this volume assess the regional and global impacts of climate change and the opportunities and challenges for adaptation. chapters and in this volume offer synthetic overviews of this work that focus specifically on adaptation and key vulnerabilities. chapter in this volume expands the discussion to explore linkages with sustainable development as do chapters and in ipcc. sustainable development was addressed in ipcc but not in ipcc. synthesis of new knowledge relating to impacts and adaptation recent work at the intersection of impacts and adaptation has confirmed that adaptation to climate change is to limited extent already happening chapter section. perhaps more importantly for this chapter recent work has also reconfirmed the utility of the prescription initially presented in smit et al. that any system vulnerability to climate change and climate variability could be described productively in terms of its exposure to the impacts of climate and its baseline sensitivity to those impacts and that both exposure and sensitivity can be influenced by that system adaptive capacity chapter section. the list of critical determinants of adaptive capacity was described in smit et al. and has been explored subsequently by for example yohe and tol adger and vincent brenkert and malone perspectives on climate change and sustainable development chapter and brooks and adger list that includes access to economic and natural resources entitlements property rights social networks institutions and governance human resources and technology chapter section. it is however important to note that recent work has also emphasised the fundamental distinction between adaptive capacity and adaptation implementation. there are significant barriers to implementing adaptation chapter section and they can arise almost anywhere. of the damages and costs caused by hurricane katrina in new orleans denominated in economic and human terms provides seminal example of this point. notwithstanding the widely accepted assertion that the united states has high adaptive capacity the impacts of hurricane katrina were fundamentally the result of failure of adaptive infrastructure improperly constructed lev\xe9es that led to false sense of security and planning deficiencies in evacuation plans particularly in many of the poorer sections of the cities. the capacity provided by public and private investment over the past few decades was designed to handle hurricane like katrina it was the anticipatory efforts to provide protection prior to landfall and response efforts after landfall that failed. that current knowledge of adaptation and adaptive capacity is insufficient for reliable prediction of adaptations it is also insufficient for rigorous evaluation of planned adaptation options measures and policies of governments page. this conclusion is often supported by noting the uneven distribution of adaptive capacity across and within societies chapter section but strong support can also be derived from the paucity of estimates of the costs of adaptation chapter section. while many adaptations can be implemented at low costs comprehensive estimates of costs and benefits of adaptation currently do not exist except perhaps for costs related to adapting to sea level rise and changes in the temporal and spatial demand for energy heating versus cooling. global diversity is one problem in this regard but there are others. anticipating the discussion of multiple stresses that chapter perspectives on climate change and sustainable development figure. sustainable development and adaptation to climate change. an outline of chapter is mapped against the pillars of sustainable development. the figure is adapted from munasinghe and swart. appears in the next section of this chapter it is now understood that climate change poses novel risks that often lie outside the range of past experience chapter section and that adaptation measures are seldom undertaken in response to climate change alone chapter sections and. impacts and adaptation in the context of multiple stresses catalogue of multiple stresses the current literature shows growing appreciation of the multiple stresses that ecological and socio economic systems face how those stresses are likely to change over the next several decades and what some of the net environmental consequences are likely to be. the pilotanalysis of global ecosystems prepared by the world resources institute wri conducted literature reviews to document the state and condition of forests agro ecosystems freshwater ecosystems and marine systems. the millennium ecosystem assessment ma comprehensively documented the condition and recent trends of ecosystems the services they provide and the socio economic context within which they occur. it also provided several scenarios of possible future conditions ma. on the way to achieving this coverage global agricultural enterprises converted more area to cropland between and than in the years between and. as of the year of the world mangrove areas and of the world coral reefs had been lost with another having been degraded significantly. ma identified major changes in land cover the consequences of which were explored by foley et al. the ma recognised two different categories of drivers of change. direct drivers of ecosystem change affect ecosystem characteristics in specific quantifiable ways examples include land cover and land use change climate change and species introductions. indirect drivers affect ecosystems in more diffuse way generally by affecting one or more direct drivers here examples are demographic changes socio political changes and economic changes. both types of drivers have changed substantially in the past few decades and will continue to do so. on the indirect side global population has doubled since the to reach billion people while the global economy has increased more than six fold. table documents expectations for how several of the direct drivers of ecosystem change are likely to change in magnitude and importance over time. with the exception of polar regions coastal ecosystems some dryland systems and montane regions climate change is not today major source of stress but climate change is the only direct driver whose magnitude and importance to series of regions ecosystems and resources is likely to continue to grow over the next several decades. table illustrates the degree to which these ecosystems are currently experiencing stresses from several direct drivers of change simultaneously. it shows that potential interactions with climate change are likely to grow over the next few decades with the magnitude of climate change itself. factors that support sustainable development brief excursion into some of the recent literature on economic development is sufficient to support the fundamental observation that the factors that determine country ability to promote sustainable development coincide with the factors that influence adaptive capacity relative to climate change climate variability and climatic extremes. the underlying prerequisites for sustainability in specific contexts are highlighted in italics in the discussion which follows. the point about coincidence in underlying factors is made by matching the terms in italics with the list of determinants of adaptive capacity identified above chapter section access to resources entitlements property rights institutions and governance human resources human capital in the economics literature and technology. they are all reflected in one or more citations from the development literature cited here and they conform well to the capital model articulated by porritt in terms of human manufactured social natural and financial capital. lucas concluded early on that differences in human capital are large enough to explain differences between the long run growth rates of poor and rich countries. moretti for example showed that businesses located in cities where the fraction of college graduates highly educated work force grew faster and experienced larger increases in productivity. explored the role of social capital in peoples abilities to successfully take advantage of financial structures they found that social capital matters most when education levels are low and law enforcement is weak. rozelle and swinnen looked at transition countries in central europe and the former soviet union they observed that countries growing steadily decade or more after economic reform had accomplished common set of intermediate goals achieving macroeconomic stability reforming property rights and creating institutions to facilitate exchange. order and timing did not matter but meeting all of these underlying objectives was critical. reviewed wide literature on the links between trade liberalisation and poverty reduction. they concluded that favourable relationship depends on the existence and stability of markets the ability of economic actors to handle changes in risk access to technology resources competent and honest government policies that promote conflict resolution and human capital accumulation. shortfalls in any of these underpinnings make it extremely difficult for the most disadvantaged citizens to see any advantage from trade. explained economic growth by variation in national perspectives on climate change and sustainable development

bank country strategic programmes and project cycle identify the need to assess the success of current adaptation to present day climate risks and climate variability especially as they may change with climate change. global and aggregate impacts three types of aggregate impacts are commonly reported. in the first impacts are computed as percent of gross domestic product gdp for specified rise in global mean temperature. in the second impacts are aggregated over time and discounted back to the present day along specified emissions scenarios such as those documented in nakićenović and swart under specified assumptions about economic development changes in technology and adaptive capacity. some of these estimates are made at the global level but others aggregate series of local or regional impacts to obtain global total. called the social cost of carbon scc it is an estimate of the economic value of the extra or marginal impact caused by the emission of one more tonne of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide at any point in time it can as well be interpreted as the marginal benefit of reducing carbon emissions by one tonne. researchers calculate scc by summing the extra impacts for as long as the extra tonne remains in the atmosphere process which requires model of atmospheric residence time and means of discounting economic values back to the year of emission. this section provides brief discussion of the historical and current status of efforts to produce aggregate estimates of the impacts of climate change. the first sub section focuses attention on economic estimates and the second begins to expand the discussion by reporting estimates calibrated in alternative metrics. history and present state of aggregate impact estimates most of the aggregate impacts reported in ipcc were of the first type they monetised the likely damage that would be caused by doubling of co concentrations. for developed countries estimated damages were of the order of of gdp. developing countries were expected to suffer larger percentage damages so mean global losses of to of world gdp were therefore reported. ipcc reported essentially the same range because more modest estimates of market damages were balanced by other factors such as higher non market impacts and improved coverage of wide range of uncertainties. most recently stern took account of full range of both impacts and possible outcomes it employed the basic economics of risk premiums to suggest that the economic effects of unmitigated climate change could reduce welfare by an amount equivalent to persistent average reduction in global per capita consumption of at least. including direct impacts on the environment and human health non market impacts increased their estimate of the total average cost of climate change to gdp including evidence which indicates that the climate system may be more responsive to greenhouse gas emissions than previously thought increased their estimates to gdp. using equity weights to reflect the expectation that share of the climate change burden will fall on poor regions of the world increased their estimated reduction in equivalent consumption per head to. figure compares the stern relationship between global impacts and increases in global mean temperature with estimates drawn from earlier studies that were assessed in ipcc. the stern trajectories all show negative impacts for all temperatures they reflect the simple assumptions of the underlying page model and focus on risks associated with higher temperatures. the two nordhaus and boyer trajectories track aggregated regional monetary estimates of damages with and without population based equity weighting they do include willingness to pay to avoid reflection of the costs of abrupt change. the various relationships depicted in figure therefore differ in their treatment of equity weighting in their efforts to capture the potential of beneficial climate change in for example chapter perspectives on climate change and sustainable development agriculture for small increases in temperature see chapter section and in their treatment of the risks of catastrophe for large increases in temperature. early calculations of the scc ipcc estimates ranged from us to per tonne of carbon in dollars stimulated recurring interest as part of wider post kyoto considerations in the economic benefits of climate change policy watkiss et al. after surveying the literature clarkson and deyes proposed central value of us per tonne of carbon in year prices for the scc with upper and lower values of us and per tonne. pearce argued that is reasonable representation of social discount rate so the probable range of the scc in should have been in the region of us to per tonne of carbon. tol gathered over estimates of the scc from published studies and combined them to form probability density function it displayed median of us per tonne of carbon mean of us per tonne and th percentile estimate equal to us per tonne. peer reviewed studies generally reported lower estimates and smaller uncertainties than those which were not their mean was us per tonne of carbon with standard deviation of us. the survey showed that of the estimates were negative to support these estimates the climate sensitivity was assumed to be low and small increases in global mean temperature brought benefits as suggested by the tol trajectories in figure. notwithstanding the differences in damage sensitivity to temperature reflected in figure the effect of the discount rate see glossary on estimates of scc is most striking. stern calculated on the basis of damage calculations described above mean estimate of the scc in of us per tonne of co us per tonne of carbon. had it been included in the tol survey it would have fallen well above the th percentile in large measure because of their adoption of low pure rate of time preference. other estimates of the scc run from less than us per tonne to over us per tonne of carbon. argued that this range reflects uncertainties in climate and impacts coverage of sectors and extremes and choices of decision variables. concluded that lower benchmark of us tc is reasonable for global decision context committed to reducing the threat of dangerous climate change and including modest level of aversion to extreme risks relatively low discount rates and equity weighting. climate change is not caused by carbon dioxide alone and integrated assessment models can calculate the social cost of each greenhouse gas under consistent assumptions. for instance the mean estimate from the page model for the social cost of methane is us per tonne emitted in in year dollars with to uncertainty range of us to per tonne. the estimate for the social cost of sf is us per tonne emitted in with to range of us to per tonne. these are all higher than the corresponding us per tonne estimate for scc that is surrounded by to range of us to per tonne hope. it has been known since ipcc that the scc will increase over time current knowledge suggests per year rate of growth. the social cost of methane will grow faster because of its shorter atmospheric lifetime. unlike later emissions any extra methane emitted today will have disappeared before the most severe climate change impacts occur watkiss et al. tol finds that much of the uncertainty in the estimates of the scc can be traced to two assumptions one on the discount rate and the other on the equity weights that are used to aggregate monetised impacts over countries. state that the extreme tails of the estimates of the scc depend as much on decision values such as discounting and equity weighting as on the climate forcing and uncertainty in the underlying impact models. damage estimates as percent of global gdp as correlated with increases in global mean temperature. damage estimates as percent of global gdp are correlated with increases in global mean temperature. that the list can be divided into two scientific and four socio economic parameters is another strong argument for the building of integrated assessment models iams models that are exclusively scientific or exclusively economic would omit parts of the climate change problem which still contain profound uncertainties. the two top influences are the climate sensitivity and the pure rate of time preference. climate sensitivity is positively correlated with the scc but the pure time preference rate is negatively correlated with the scc. in the later studies lower estimates for market sector impacts in developed countries are offset by higher non market impacts equity weights and inclusion of estimates of the possible impacts of large scale discontinuities tol. hitz and smith found that the relationships between global mean temperature and impacts of the sort displayed in figure are not consistent across sectors for modest amounts of warming. beyond an approximate to increase in global mean temperature above pre industrial levels all sectors except possibly forestry show increasingly adverse impacts. tol found that few studies cover non market damages the risk of potential extreme weather socially contingent effects or the potential for longer term catastrophic events. therefore uncertainty in the value of the scc is derived not only from the true value of impacts that are covered by the models but also from impacts that have not yet been quantified and valued. and displayed in figure existing estimates of scc are products of work that spans only sub set of impacts for which complete estimates might be calculated. nonetheless current estimates do provide enough information to support meaningful discussions about reducing the emissions of co methane and other greenhouse gases and the appropriate trade off between gases. nonetheless estimates of scc offer consistent way to internalise current knowledge about the impacts of climate change into development mitigation and or adaptation decisions that the private and public sector will be making over the near term morimoto and hope. according to economic theory if the social cost calculations were complete and markets were perfect then efforts to cut back the emissions of greenhouse gases would continue as long as the marginal cost of the cutbacks were lower than the social cost of the impacts they cause. in any comparison between greenhouse gases according to pearce the scc is the correct figure to use. for reference spot prices for permits in the european carbon trading scheme since its inception early in started out towards the bottom end of the range of the scc but they rose quickly to around us per tonne of carbon before falling by about in the early summer of amid concerns that the carbon allowances allocated by the european commission at the start of the scheme had been too generous. in the real world markets are not perfect calculations of the scc are far from complete and both mask significant differences between regions and types of impacts. chapter perspectives on climate change and sustainable development parameter definition sign range importance climate

reef ecosystems to withstand the impacts of climate change will depend on the extent of degradation from other anthropogenic pressures and the frequency of future bleaching events donner et al. in addition to coral bleaching there are other threats to reefs associated with climate change kleypas and langdon. cores from long lived massive corals indicate past minor variations in calcification lough and barnes but disintegration of degraded reefs following bleaching or reduced calcification may result in increased wave energy across reef flats with potential for shoreline erosion sheppard

environmental or anthropogenic stresses hallock. slight rise in sea level is likely to result in the submergence of some indo pacific reef flats and recolonisation by corals as these intertidal surfaces presently emerged at low tide become suitable for coral growth buddemeier et al. an intensification of tropical storms section could have devastating consequences on the reefs themselves as well as for the inhabitants of many low lying islands sections and. there is limited evidence that global warming may result in an increase of coral range for example the extension of branching

collapse of ecological and social systems on atolls. there are limited data little local expertise to assess the dangers and low level of economic activity to cover the costs of adaptation for atolls in countries such as the maldives kiribati and tuvalu barnett and adger chapter box. climate change and the great barrier reef chapter box the great barrier reef gbr is the world largest continuous reef system km long and is critical storehouse of australian marine biodiversity and breeding ground for seabirds and other marine vertebrates such as the humpback whale. the two greatest threats from climate change to the gbr are rising sea temperatures which are almost certain to increase the frequency and intensity of mass coral bleaching events and ii ocean acidification which is likely to reduce the calcifying ability of key organisms such as corals. other factors such as droughts and more intense storms are likely to influence reefs through physical damage and extended flood plumes puotinen. temperatures only above the long term summer maxima already cause mass coral bleaching loss of symbiotic algae. mortality was distributed patchily with the greatest effects on near shore reefs possibly exacerbated by osmotic stress caused by floodwaters in some areas berkelmans and oliver. the event was followed by localised outbreaks of coral disease with incidence of some disease like syndromes increasing by as much as over the past decade at few sites willis et al. while the impacts of coral disease on the gbr are currently minor experiences in other parts of the world suggest that disease has the potential to be threat to gbr reefs. effects from thermal stress are likely to be exacerbated under future scenarios by the gradual acidification of the world oceans which have absorbed about of the excess co released to the atmosphere orr et al raven et al. reduced growth due to acidic conditions is very likely to hinder reef recovery after bleaching events and will reduce the resilience of reefs to other stressors sediment eutrophication. even under moderate warming scenario by corals on the gbr are very likely to be exposed to regular summer temperatures that exceed the thermal thresholds observed over the past years done et al. given that the recovery time from severe bleaching induced mortality event is at least years and may exceed years for full recovery these models suggest that reefs are likely to be dominated by non coral organisms such as macroalgae by hoegh guldberg done et al. maintenance of hard coral cover on the gbr will require corals to increase their upper thermal tolerance limits at the same pace as the change in sea temperatures driven by climate change about decade donner et al. there is currently little evidence that corals have the capacity for such rapid genetic change most of the evidence is to the contrary hoegh guldberg. given that recovery from mortality can be potentially enhanced by reducing local stresses water quality fishing pressure management initiatives such as the reef water quality protection plan and the representative areas programme which expanded totally protected areas on the gbr from to over represent planned adaptation options to enhance the ability of coral reefs to endure the rising pressure from rapid climate change. impact of coral mortality on reef fisheries chapter box coral reefs and their fisheries are subject to many stresses in addition to climate change see chapter. so far events such as the mass coral bleaching in the indian ocean have not provided evidence of negative short term bio economic impacts for coastal reef fisheries spalding and jarvis grandcourt and cesar. in the longer term there may be serious consequences for fisheries production that result from loss of coral communities and reduced structural complexity which result in reduced fish species richness local extinctions and loss of species within key functional groups of reef fish sano graham et al. multiple stresses on coral reefs non climate change threats to coral reefs of small islands chapter box large number of non climate change stresses and disturbances mainly driven by human activities can impact coral reefs nystr\xf6m et al hughes et al. it has been suggested that the coral reef crisis is almost certainly the result of complex and synergistic interactions among global scale climatic stresses and local scale human imposed stresses buddemeier et al. four human threat factors coastal development marine pollution over exploitation and destructive fishing and

fourth assessment report of the panel on climate change. cross chapter case studies introduction deltas and megadeltas hotspots for vulnerability chapter box deltas some of the largest sedimentary deposits in the world are widely recognised as being highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change particularly sea level rise and changes in runoff as well as being subject to stresses imposed by human modification of catchment and delta plain land use. most deltas are already undergoing natural subsidence that results in accelerated rates of relative sea level rise above the global average. many are impacted by the effects of water extraction and diversion as well as declining sediment input as consequence of entrapment in dams. delta plains particularly those in asia see are densely populated and large numbers of people are often impacted as result of external terrestrial influences river floods sediment starvation and or external marine influences storm surges erosion see figure. estimated that nearly million people inhabit sample of deltas globally including all the large megadeltas. average population density is people km with the largest population in the ganges brahmaputra delta and the highest density in the nile delta. many of these deltas and megadeltas are associated with significant and expanding urban areas. used generalised modelling approach to approximate the effective rate of sea level rise under present conditions basing estimates of sediment trapping and flow diversion on global dam database and modifying estimates of natural subsidence to incorporate accelerated human induced subsidence. this analysis showed that much of the population of these deltas is at risk through coastal erosion and land loss primarily as result of decreased sediment delivery by the rivers but also through accentuated rates of sea level rise. they estimate using coarse digital terrain model and global population distribution data that more than million people will be directly affected by in three megadeltas the ganges brahmaputra delta in bangladesh the mekong delta in vietnam and the nile delta in egypt. more than people are likely to be directly impacted in each of further nine deltas and more than in each of further twelve deltas figure. this generalised modelling approach indicates that of the population affected live on asian megadeltas and deltas and large proportion of the remainder are on deltas in africa. these impacts would be exacerbated by accelerated sea level rise and enhanced human pressures see. within the asian megadeltas the surface topography is complex as result of the development of the deltas and the population distribution shows considerable spatial variability reflecting the intensive land use and the growth of some of the world largest megacities woodroffe et al. many people in these and other deltas worldwide are already subject to flooding from both storm surges and seasonal river floods and therefore it is necessary to develop further methods to assess individual delta vulnerability s\xe1nchez arcilla et al. relative vulnerability of coastal deltas as shown by the indicative population potentially displaced by current sea level trends to extreme million high million to medium to following ericson et al. megadeltas in asia megadeltas in asia chapter section table there are eleven megadeltas with an area greater than km table in the coastal zone of asia that are continuously being formed by rivers originating from the tibetan plateau milliman and meade penland and kulp these megadeltas are vital to asia because they are home to millions of people especially in the seven megacities that are located in these deltas nicholls woodroffe et al. the megadeltas particularly the zhujiang delta changjiang delta and huanghe delta are also economically important accounting for substantial proportion of china total gdp niou she. however the megadeltas ofasia are vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise that could increase the frequency and level of inundation of megadeltas due to storm surges and floods from river drainage nicholls woodroffe et al putting communities biodiversity and infrastructure at risk of being damaged. this impact could be more pronounced in megacities located in megadeltas where natural ground subsidence is enhanced by human activities such as in bangkok in the chao phraya delta shanghai in the changjiang delta tianjin in the old huanghe delta nguyen et al li et al jiang woodroffe et al. climate change together with human activities could also enhance erosion that has for example caused the lena delta to retreat at rate of to yr leont yev and has affected the progradation and retreat of megadeltas fed by rivers originating from the tibetan plateau li et al thanh et al shi et al woodroffe et al. the adverse impacts of salt water intrusion on water supply in the changjiang delta and zhujiang delta mangrove forests agriculture production and freshwater fish catch resulting in loss of us per annum in the indus delta could also be aggravated by climate change iucn shen et al huang and zhang. externally the sediment supplies to many megadeltas have been reduced by the construction of dams and there are plans for many more dams in the st century see woodroffe et al. the reduction of sediment supplies makes these systems much more vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise. when considering all the non climate pressures there is very high confidence that the group of populated asian megadeltas is highly threatened by climate change and responding to this threat will present important challenges see also. the sustainability of megadeltas in asia in warmer climate will rest heavily on policies and programmes that promote integrated and co ordinated development of the megadeltas and upstream areas balanced use and development of megadeltas for conservation and production goals and comprehensive protection against erosion from river flow anomalies and sea water actions that combines structural with human and institutional capability building measures du and zhang inam et al li et al thanh et al saito woodroffe et al wolanski. climate change and the fisheries of the lower mekong an example of multiple stresses on megadelta fisheries system due to human activity chapter box fisheries are central to the lives of the people particularly the rural poor who live in the lower mekong countries. two thirds of the basin million people are in some way active in fisheries which represent about of the gdp of cambodia and lao people democratic republic pdr. there are approximately species of fish commonly found in the river with many more marine vagrants making it one of the most prolific and diverse faunas in the world mrc. recent estimates of the annual catch from capture fisheries alone exceed mtonnes hortle and bush with the delta contributing over of this. direct effects of climate will occur due to changing patterns of precipitation snow melt and rising sea level which will affect hydrology and water quality. indirect effects will result from changing vegetation patterns that may alter the food chain and increase soil erosion. it is likely that human impacts on the fisheries caused by population growth flood mitigation increased water abstractions changes in land use and over fishing will be greater than the effects of climate but the pressures are strongly interrelated. an analysis of the impact of climate change scenarios on the flow of the mekong hoanh et al estimated increased maximum monthly flows of to in the basin and to in the delta lower value is for years to and higher value for years to compared with to levels. minimum monthly flows were estimated to decrease by to in the basin and to in the delta. increased flooding would positively affect fisheries yields but reduction in dry season habitat may reduce recruitment of some species. however planned water management interventions primarily dams are expected to have the opposite effects on hydrology namely marginally decreasing wet season flows and considerably increasing dry season flows world bank. models indicate that even modest sea level rise of cm would cause contour lines of water levels in the mekong delta to shift km towards the sea during the flood season and salt water to move further upstream although confined within canals during the dry season wassmann et al. inland movement of salt water would significantly alter the species composition of fisheries but may not be detrimental for overall fisheries yields. of particular importance are the megadeltas of the lena km and mackenzie km rivers which are fed by the largest arctic rivers of cross chapter case

katrina and coastal ecosystem services in the mississippi delta chapter box whereas an individual hurricane event cannot be attributed to climate change it can serve to illustrate the consequences for ecosystem services if the intensity and or frequency of such events were to increase in the future. one result of hurricane katrina which made landfall in coastal louisiana on august was the loss of km of coastal wetlands levees and islands that flank new orleans in the mississippi river deltaic plain barras figure. hurricane rita which struck in september had relatively minor effects on this part of the louisiana coast which are included in this estimate the chandeleur islands which lie south east of the city were reduced to roughly half of their former extent as direct result of hurricane katrina. collectively these natural systems serve as the first line of defence against storm surge in this highly populated region. while some habitat recovery is expected it is likely to be minimal compared to the scale of the losses. the chandeleur islands serve as an important wintering ground for migratory waterfowl and neo tropical birds large population of north american redhead

taken to improve protection. in late august hurricane katrina which had been category storm but weakened to category before landfall moved onto the louisiana and mississippi coast with storm surge
